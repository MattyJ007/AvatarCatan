    public static String irohDesc = "Iroh was a retired Fire Nation General, a former Crown Prince of the nation, a Grand Lotus of the Order of the White Lotus,[1] a firebending master, and a wise mentor to his nephew Zuko.[3] He was the elder son of Fire Lord Azulon and Ilah, and the older brother of Ozai.[4] Iroh's well-known ability to breathe fire, and his claims of \"slaying\" the last dragon, earned him the honorary title \"The Dragon of the West\".[5][6]\n" +
            "Unlike many other individuals from the Fire Nation, particularly those within his own family, Iroh was a wise, easy-going, and spiritual man. He appreciated and admired the balance of the four elements, and even incorporated aspects of the other elements into his own firebending techniques.[7] Iroh aided Avatar Aang and his companions on several occasions, and was consequently branded as a traitor.[8] An extremely perceptive person, it was claimed that he journeyed to the Spirit World in search of his deceased son Lu Ten.[8][9] His knowledge and respect for the four elements allowed him to provide advice to others; he assisted many close associates and friends.[5][7][10][11]\n" +
            "After the traumatic death of his son, Iroh saw Zuko as his own son rather than his nephew,[12] and encouraged him to choose his own destiny, rather than a fate members of the royal family expected of him. Upon Zuko's coronation as Fire Lord after Ozai's defeat and the conflict's conclusion, he reopened the Jasmine Dragon tea shop, and served tea for the rest of his retirement.[13] When he deemed his business in the mortal world finished, Iroh chose to leave his body behind and travel to the Spirit World, where he continued serving tea to various spirits.[14]\n" +

            "Iroh enjoying a playful moment with his son, Lu Ten.\n" +
            "Iroh was the eldest son of Azulon and Ilah, and grandson of Fire Lord Sozin. He was formerly the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation, and destined to become the new Fire Lord. He had one son, Lu Ten, with whom he was close.\n" +
            "Iroh once visited the Sun Warriors, where he stood before the original firebenders: a pair of dragons, Ran and Shaw. He managed to prove himself worthy, and they revealed to him the true secrets of firebending, without recourse to hatred and aggression. Iroh later claimed that he had fought and killed the last surviving dragon in order to preserve what was left of the species and to ensure that the Sun Warriors remained undisturbed.[6] Because of this claim and his ability to breathe fire, Iroh earned the title \"The Dragon of the West\".\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Like his father before him, Iroh was a renowned Fire Nation General during the Hundred Year War. Acting on a vision he had witnessed in his youth which told him he would capture the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se,[1] Iroh besieged the great city for six hundred days, and successfully breached the Outer Wall â€“ a feat that had never been equaled before.[15] However, before he could breach the Inner Wall, his son Lu Ten was killed on the front lines, and in his grief, Iroh lost most of his fighting spirit and abandoned the siege.[4] The Siege of Ba Sing Se came to be seen as a terrible dishonor and failure for Iroh.[12][16]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As Iroh was returning home from the siege, his father Fire Lord Azulon died under mysterious circumstances. Although Iroh was the Crown Prince, his younger brother Ozai was appointed Fire Lord, apparently on the dying request of Azulon himself.[4] Having lost his desire for power after the death of Lu Ten, Iroh did not fight for his right to the throne, and Ozai took power without incident.[17] Although Iroh retired as a general, he was still well respected in the Fire Nation and well-liked by soldiers because of his personality.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Distraught by the death of his son, Iroh thought it was necessary that he temporarily retract from his usual work as a general to recuperate. He did not immediately return to the Fire Nation after the siege and instead went on a journey throughout the world, which included a spiritual adventure. It was even rumored that he went to the Spirit World in search of Lu Ten.[9] These experiences had a profound impact on Iroh, as he eventually changed his perspective on the world and his life. In the past, Iroh had focused on his work in the military and preparing to become a Fire Lord, but after Lu Ten's death, he realized these were not the most important aspects of his life. The aging general wanted to relax and appreciate life more, an attitude that led to his retirement and engendered a relationship between him and Zuko. Iroh felt empathy for the young prince, who had been injured and shamefully banished by his father, and wished to help him with his struggles; Zuko's uncle viewed him as an adopted son.[17]\n" +

            "Iroh observing in horror the Agni Kai between Zuko and Ozai.\n" +
            "Around 97 AG, an indulgent Iroh allowed his beloved nephew to observe a meeting of Fire Lord Ozai's war council under the promise that he would not speak. However, Zuko did speak up, and even though Iroh silently agreed with him, the Fire Lord demanded that Zuko participate in an Agni Kai for his insubordination. Iroh witnessed how Zuko refused to duel his father, though averted his gaze when Ozai proceeded to burn Zuko in the face.[18] Iroh subsequently accompanied Zuko on his quest to find the Avatar, and it was through Iroh's influence that Zuko was able to procure a ship and a crew.[18]\n" +
            "Zuko and Iroh at the Western Air Temple\n" +
            "Iroh sadly recognizing Zuko's deep bitterness over his banishment.\n" +
            "The pair spent nearly three years at sea, searching in vain for any sign of the centenarian airbender the Fire Sages had described, traveling to several locations including the Western Air Temple. From the beginning of their quest, Iroh attempted to help his nephew as best he could, greatly caring for Zuko's well-being and health. However, the banished prince often misinterpreted Iroh's advice, like taking \"some time to heal and rest\" at the Western Air Temple, as laziness, and they restlessly continued the search.[19] Consequently, Iroh was resigned to the futility of their mission and whittled away his days with games. He would continue to assist Zuko mostly by offering advice through proverbs and teaching him firebending, strategy, and leadership skills. Zuko was an impatient student, who was anxious to learn combat quickly, and had little time for the life lessons Iroh wanted to impart on him, though Iroh persisted.[3]\n" +

            "Iroh assisting Zuko in attacking Aang.\n" +
            "Eventually, a day came when a strange beacon lit the skies off the coast of the South Pole. When Zuko investigated, he discovered that the Avatar had reappeared at last.[3] Improbably, the long-sought old man was actually Aang, a twelve-year-old boy recently woken from a hundred years of suspended animation. Thrown off-guard, Zuko underestimated the boy, who managed to escape their grasp. When Aang escaped, Zuko and Iroh attacked his bison with a combined fire-blast. Aang redirected the attack into an Iceberg, causing Zuko's ship to be buried in ice.[20] From that point on, Zuko engaged in hot pursuit, tracking the Avatar and his friends across the globe, while Iroh mostly stayed in the background, instructing Zuko in firebending and offering advice.\n" +

            "Iroh captured\n" +
            "Iroh being ambushed and detained by earthbending soldiers.\n" +
            "During their pursuit of the Avatar, Zuko and Iroh stopped at a location along the coast of the Earth Kingdom for a short landfall. As Iroh bathed in a natural spring, heating it himself, Zuko came to demand that he return to the ship, but Iroh argued that he preferred to continue relaxing. Zuko relented and allowed Iroh to stay for a half hour, which Iroh happily took advantage of. He relaxed to the point where he fell asleep.\n" +
            "Iroh woke up to the sound of a meadow vole chirping around the spring. He was quite pleased with his nap, until he felt rumbling under the spring. Land slid up to bind him, and Iroh was captured by a team of earthbenders. The earthbender captain, who had fought at Ba Sing Se before, recognized Iroh as the former general who had led the siege, and he and his men decided to take Iroh to Ba Sing Se in chains for trial and punishment. At one point of the way, however, Iroh feigned sleepiness and fell off his ostrich horse. When the soldiers picked him up, he slyly left behind a sandal to mark his passage for his prospective rescuers.\n" +

            "Zuko interfering with an attempt to permanently handicap Iroh.\n" +
            "The next morning, Iroh incidentally saw the spirit of Fang flying overhead, startling him. He later claimed that his handcuffs were too loose and making him uncomfortable, asking if they would be tightened, to which the captain agreed. When a soldier went to tighten the cuff, Iroh breathed fire, heating it up to scalding temperatures and thus burning the soldier's hand. He jumped off the ostrich horse, fired a fire-blast, which confused the animals, and rolled himself off the cliff. The captain and two other soldiers went after him, and captured him at the bottom.\n" +
            "The captain decided that Iroh was too dangerous to take to Ba Sing Se as he was, and he and his men took their prisoner to a quarry, laid his hands out on a stone slab, and prepared to crush them. At that moment, Zuko, who had been tracking Iroh, partly by picking up the sandal Iroh dropped, came in to rescue his uncle. He broke his chains, and the two of them fought and defeated the earthbenders.[16]\n" +

            "Iroh debating with Zhao over his lack of respect for the spirits of their world.\n" +
            "When Admiral Zhao was gathering forces for his Siege of the North, he conscripted Zuko's crew, and offered Iroh a position as an adviser General. Iroh turned him down, but Zhao insisted the position was still offered anyway. Later, after Zhao attempted to kill Zuko, Iroh took the position so that he could help Zuko stow away on Zhao's ship. Zhao offered false comfort to Iroh for Zuko's \"death\", and the two of them toasted victory.[21] After the admiral began his attack on the Northern Water Tribe, Iroh advised him to withdraw his forces at sundown, as waterbenders drew their powers from the moon, and it was nearly full that night. Zhao agreed, although he stated that he was working on a solution to take care of \"the moon problem\".[12]\n" +
            "That night, Zuko was planning to leave and sneak into the Northern Water Tribe to capture Aang. Iroh met him there, and gave him advice, but Zuko shrugged him off. Iroh told Zuko that he only nagged him because he had thought of Zuko as being like his own son, ever since Lu Ten died. Zuko said he knew, promised to return to Iroh after he captured the Avatar, and left.[12]\n" +

            "Iroh easily besting the firebenders within the Spirit Oasis.\n" +
            "The next morning, Zhao resumed his attack. When Iroh reminded him that they had a time limit, Zhao stated that he simply intended to destroy the moon. He told Iroh about a library he found in the desert, and how he found the mortal identities of the Moon and Ocean Spirits. Although Iroh warned him not to trifle with the spirits, Zhao intended to go to the Spirit Oasis and kill Tui.\n" +
            "When Zhao finally captured the Moon Spirit, Aang and his friends tried to convince him to let it go, and that killing the moon would destroy the whole world. Iroh agreed, and, despite Zhao calling him a traitor, warned Zhao not to harm the spirit, threatening ten-fold retribution. At first, Zhao let the spirit go, but became enraged and scorched the spirit anyway. Iroh responded by attacking him and his men with a brief, but aggressive, display of his firebending powers. The soldiers were quickly defeated, but Zhao managed to escape during the confusion. While everyone was despairing for the world, Iroh realized that Yue contained some of the life of the Moon Spirit, and that she could give it back. Yue did so, and saved the moon by taking its place. Afterward, Iroh slipped away, and left the Northern Water Tribe with Zuko.[8]\n" +

            "Iroh demonstrating lightning generation to Zuko.\n" +
            "Iroh and Zuko have been branded traitors of the Fire Nation.[8] After a confrontation with Azula, Iroh and Zuko learned of a plot to capture them and return them home in chains. After escaping from Azula's nearly successful plot, Iroh and Zuko cut their top-knots both to symbolize their new life as fugitives unable to return home, and also to disguise themselves.[22] The two later took refuge in a river village[23] and other Earth Kingdom towns and caves, acting as homeless beggars. While Iroh was able to adjust to a life of simplicity, humility, and poverty, Zuko was not, and Iroh soon suspected that Zuko had been obtaining items for their day-to-day life by theft. The older man attempted to persuade his nephew that those who maintain hope in the face of adversity are the ones with true strength. However, Zuko thought otherwise, and the two separated.[24] The two were soon reunited, as Iroh covertly followed Zuko in case he needed assistance. When Zuko got in over his head in a three-way battle with Aang and Azula, Iroh intervened, as did Aang's companions. The six of them confronted Azula together, but she managed to wound Iroh with a blue fire blast to the chest, and she escaped.[10]\n" +
            "After recovering from his injury, Iroh decided to teach Zuko the advanced firebending techniques he would need to defeat Azula. He first tried to teach Zuko how to create lightning, but his nephew's emotional turmoil prevented him from making progress with the difficult technique. Instead, Iroh taught Zuko a technique of his own creationâ€”to absorb and redirect lightning, which he developed after studying waterbenders. Zuko soon demanded that Iroh attack him with lightning so that he can redirect it, but Iroh refused to perform such a dangerous test, unlike his brother Ozai.[7]\n" +

Iroh and Zuko sought their aid in avoiding the bounty hunters Master Yu and Xin Fu, who temporarily decided to seek the two fugitives from the firebending nation rather than pursue the Avatar and Toph. The Order managed, on short notice, to produce fake passports and other paperwork to smuggle Iroh and Zuko into Ba Sing Se.[25]\n" +
            "Life in Ba Sing Se\n" +
            "With the Order of the White Lotus' help, Iroh and Zuko were able to make their way to Ba Sing Se as refugees.[26] Once inside,[15] Iroh got them jobs at a tea shop.[2] While on a day off, Iroh spent the day shopping in the city. During his travels, Iroh displayed his skill as a teacher as he granted wisdom and help to all those he encountered during his day of shopping. He later held a small memorial service for Lu Ten, marking his late son's birthday, and tearfully said he wished he could have helped Lu Ten.[11]\n" +

            "After weeks in Ba Sing Se, Iroh was given the chance to run his own tea shop, but Zuko had other plans.[2] When Zuko attempted to capture Appa, Iroh confronted Zuko and told him rather bluntly to stop trying to live the life people said he had to live. Iroh convinced Zuko to give up his alias as the Blue Spirit[27] and cared for Zuko when he became ill as a result of his actions under Lake Laogai, which were in complete conflict with Zuko's image of himself. Through the ordeal, Iroh reassured Zuko that when he came out of his illness, he would be the \"beautiful prince\" he was always meant to be, and remained confident that Zuko will be the one person to redeem the wrongdoings of the Fire Nation.[28]\n" +
            "When Azula offered Zuko a chance to reclaim his honor by helping take over the Earth Kingdom capital, he agreed. Iroh was last seen defending the lifeless body of the Avatar and Katara, giving them time to escape before he peacefully allowed himself to be captured. Iroh made eye contact with Zuko before turning away, expressing shame at his nephew's decision.[5]\n" +

After threatening the guard to keep silent about the visit, Zuko attempted to talk to his uncle, only to have Iroh turn away from him and say nothing. Zuko later brought food to Iroh and asked for his help. Iroh continued to remain silent, causing Zuko to become angry and storm out of the room. A single tear rolled down Iroh's face.[29]\n" +
            "While in prison, Warden Poon gave Iroh his food. Poon mocked a markedly disheveled Iroh as he scrambled for the gruel, even scooping what had fallen onto the ground into his mouth. As soon as Poon was gone, he became more collected, wiped the sweaty hair out of his face and calmly finished his meal in peace, only eating out of the bowl. Iroh was shown again, calmly lying on the ground deep in thought. Suddenly his eyes widen and he began aggressively doing bent-knee sit ups. Later, Iroh was still mocked and ridiculed by Poon, while still feigning insanity. At the prison, Iroh continued to train in Poon's absence, having upgraded to a more difficult variation of sit-up, the straight-legged inverted sit-ups. He kept up the facade of loneliness and desperation in front of Poon. Iroh was seen to be training whenever not under watch, being able to perform difficult exercises including but not limited to inverted crunches, inverted push-ups, and one handed pull ups. Meanwhile, still keeping his jailer unaware, Iroh had managed to recondition his body back to its original, intimidating form, and even managed to lose his pronounced belly, which he slyly hid by stuffing spare clothing under his robes.[30]\n" +

            "Iroh somehow managed to get a message to Zuko, urging him to educate himself on his great-grandfather. Zuko later angrily went to the Fire Nation jail tower and, bursting into his cell, accused Iroh of having sent him the message. He angrily demanded the point, as the testament did not even reveal anything about Sozin's death. Iroh admitted to having sent the message and explained that the message that Zuko must find out about his great-grandfather's death did not refer to his paternal great-grandfather, Sozin, but his maternal great-grandfather was none other than Avatar Roku. He proceeded, producing the lost crown prince's headpiece, once worn by both his great-grandfathers, and gave it to a stunned Zuko. Iroh explained to the prince that, as he had both Roku and Sozin's blood in his veins, he alone had the ability to redeem their family by choosing which of their paths to follow. He had the royal headpiece stashed behind one of the cell's bricks.[31]\n" +

            "Iroh told Ming that it would be wise for her to leave the prison and go home, hinting that something will happen.[32] Iroh broke himself out of prison during the eclipse and single-handedly defeated Warden Poon and everybody else inside. The defeated Poon later told Zuko, who intended to free his uncle himself, that Iroh was like a \"one-man army\".[33] Iroh managed to leave the Fire Nation and enter the Earth Kingdom after his escape.[1]\n" +

            "Iroh is brought to tears upon being reunited with Zuko.\n" +
            "Zuko was deeply troubled by his betrayal toward his uncle afterward, and his feelings about this were shown when both he and his uncle were depicted on stage in the play \"The Boy in the Iceberg\".[34] When Aang disappeared before the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Zuko attempted to track Aang down by hiring June the bounty hunter.[35] When June was unable to find Aang, Zuko had her track down his uncle, knowing that he was the only other possible person who could defeat the Fire Lord. He used Iroh's stinky sandal, which he apparently kept, as a scent for June's shirshu to track down the source. Zuko discovered that Iroh was in Ba Sing Se with the Order of the White Lotus, where he intended on leading the Order into battle with the Fire Nation occupational forces and reclaim the city in the name of the Earth Kingdom. Zuko tearfully confronted Iroh in his tent, stating that he was ashamed of what he did in Ba Sing Se and was willing to do anything to gain his uncle's forgiveness. Before Zuko could even finish his sentence, Iroh grabbed him and embraced him, stating that he was never angry with Zuko, just sad that he lost his way. Iroh told Zuko he was happy he found him and happy that he found his way again.[1]\n" +
            "Return\n" +
            "While going over the battle plans, he said that he could not face the Fire Lord in the Avatar's absence, because he did not know if he could win, and he was afraid that history would just look upon it as more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother for power.\n" +

He proclaimed that Zuko must be the new Fire Lord, for he had the ideas and the honor to restore the Fire Nation's own honor. He told Zuko he must return to the Fire Nation, but warned him that Azula would be waiting. He told his nephew that he would not be able to fight Azula alone, and Zuko subsequently asked Katara for her help in \"putting Azula in her place\".[1]\n" +
            "Iroh's assault on Ba Sing Se[36] eventually succeeded, and the vision of his youth[1] was proven true, as he \"recaptured\" the city in the name of the Earth Kingdom.

            "Just as he had hoped, Iroh spent his days after the end of the Hundred Year War running the Jasmine Dragon and perspicuously playing Pai Sho. When Zuko felt conflicted he would talk to a picture of Iroh, expressing his desire that Iroh were with him, though he never followed through. Zuko knew that a quiet life was all Iroh ever wanted and therefore, knowing that there was no better way to repay his former mentor for all he had done, left Iroh in peace. For almost a year, Iroh was oblivious to the events that transpired at Yu Dao. Later, when Zuko fainted after the conflict of the Harmony Restoration Movement, Aang took him to the Jasmine Dragon, and Iroh cared for Zuko while he recovered. When Zuko finally awoke, Iroh alerted Aang, who was meditating on top of the building. Iroh thanked Aang for bringing Zuko to him, and pointed out that even though Zuko was Fire Lord now, he was still a stubborn boy and should not forget that he still had a place here. When Aang and Zuko talked, Iroh came by to serve them his newest beverage, which consisted of balls of tapioca that were cooked until soft, before being placed in tea. Iroh claimed that his invention was a revolution in tea. Despite this, Zuko and Aang both disliked the drink, causing Iroh to sadly remark that he was \"a man ahead of [his] time\".[37]\n" +

            "Sometime later, Iroh returned to the Fire Nation Royal Palace to act as the interim Fire Lord while Zuko would be out searching for his mother. As Zuko explained the goal of his quest to his friends, Iroh expressed his hopes that his nephew would find \"who and what\" he was searching for. Iroh also reasoned with Aang, who was reluctant to let Azula come with them unbound, stating that just as Zuko yearned for peace and hoped to find it by finding his mother, the same could perhaps be said for his sister.\n" +

When Suki asked whether or not there was something she could do for him to make him feel more at home, Iroh stated that the problem was that the Fire Nation had too many weapons and not enough tea. He subsequently performed his first action as interim Fire Lord by announcing a \"National Tea Appreciation Day\", and replaced the spear of a nearby guard with a cup of tea, encouraging him to drink it.[38] Even though Iroh appreciated being Fire Lord more than he thought he would, it also made him miss his tea shop in Ba Sing Se.[39]\n" +
            "When Zuko returned from his quest, he received a tip that the New Ozai Society was plotting against him and sent a message for the Kyoshi Warriors to rendezvous with his ship. Upon hearing that Zuko required a decoy, Iroh quickly volunteered. Arriving via submarine, Iroh was the first one to pop out before embracing his nephew. Noticing Ursa, he expressed his gratitude at seeing her once more and his regret at how she suffered at the hands of his family. Ursa then embraced him, saying he had nothing to be sorry for and that his presence in the family always gave her hope.\n" +

            "Upon arrival at the capitol harbor, as Iroh put on his performance, he explained to a puzzled guard next to him that he needed to feel genuine angst for his act. As Iroh's caravan made their way along the main road to the capitol, as expected, they were attacked by the New Ozai Society. Iroh was ready to leap into action, but Mai, Ty Lee, and their Kyoshi Warrior detachment had already subdued their attackers. Mai noted that her father sent only six soldiers to attack Iroh, before everyone noticed a distress flare sent by Suki and they realized they had been fooled. Iroh joined the others in racing to Zuko's location via hot air balloon and was delighted to finally see some action.\n" +

When Zuko concerned over Ursa's apprehension at re-entering the palace, Iroh assured him that she just needs time. Iroh then noticed that something else was bothering Zuko. The Fire Lord confessed that the New Ozai Society was becoming a significant threat, so he requested his uncle to attend the Yu Dao inauguration ceremony in his place while he remained to deal with the insurrectionists.[40]\n" +

After a meditation session, just as Aang, Katara and Sokka were prepared to set off for the South Pole, a messenger hawk arrived with a message from Zuko requesting Aang's aid. Iroh bid his friends farewell as Aang and Appa headed to the Fire Nation, while Katara and Sokka left for the Southern Water Tribe.[41]\n" +

            "Life in the Spirit World\n" +
            "Sometime after 131 AG, feeling that he had done all he could in the material world, Iroh chose to ascend to the Spirit World, leaving his mortal body behind and letting his soul make a new home there, where he made friends with many spirits, and also constructed a new tea shop.[42]\n" +
            "Spirit Iroh\n" +
            "Now living in Spirit World, the late Iroh finds Avatar Korra.\n" +
            "In 171 AG, Iroh came across Avatar Korra, who had reverted to her four-year-old self, and a baby dragon bird spirit, while walking through a dark forest. Noting that they appeared lost, he offered to help them. Since he had been good friends with Avatar Aang, he was instantly recognized by Korra, and he subsequently guided the young Avatar out of the forest to a brighter part of the Spirit World. He expressed his pleasure over her visit, and noted that she was just in time to join the wedding celebrations of May-Jim. He offered Korra tea and cake, and when she recognized Wan's teapot as her own, Iroh explained how when she was Avatar Wan, she had used it to carry Raava before they permanently bonded, adding that tea poured out of the cup still retained a hint of light. Later, he explained to Korra about the legend and finesses of Pai Sho while he played with a tulip-shaped spirit who seemed to struggle.\n" +
            "Noticing that Korra seemed depressed, Iroh asked what was wrong, to which the young Avatar said that she came there with her friend, but had become separated from her, leaving her by herself. Iroh tried to tell her that she was not alone, but a distraught Korra erupted in a tantrum, saying she wanted to go home and did not like the Spirit World, causing the skies to darken and the spirits to grow restless. Iroh urged Korra to stop, explaining to her that her emotions became reality in the Spirit World, especially for the Avatar, and that she needed to stay positive. He wiped her tears away with a small cloth, and the Avatar apologized, causing the spirits and the sky to both stabilize. The elderly man added that if she sought the light, she would find it, but looking for the dark would mean that it is all she would ever see. Korra tried to apply what she had just learned to find Jinora, but Iroh stated that finding the young airbender would not be that easy. When Korra asked for advice, he imparted the wisdom that sometimes the best way to help oneself is to help others, recommending she took the dragon bird spirit home, pointed Korra toward its home atop Hai-Riyo Peak.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Iroh and Korra\n" +
            "Iroh reassures Korra that she has peace and light inside of her and as such has the ability to change her surroundings for the better.\n" +
            "Iroh accompanied Korra for a while, but when the scared girl asked him if he would accompany her, Iroh squatted down and gently told her that she needed to make the trip on her own. He explained that the darkness on the peak was caused by the darkness and anger brought by the people who had been frequenting the Spirit World lately, but since Korra had light and peace within her, he pointed out that she could change the world around her. To prove his point, Iroh asked her if she still thought the dragon bird was scary like she had upon their first encounter, and after she replied that it was not, he noted that many things that seemed threatening in the dark would prove to be welcoming by shedding light on it. After embracing the young Avatar, Iroh told her that it was nice meeting her, and invited her to come visit him again, whether it was in her present life or her next incarnation.[14]\n" +
            "During Harmonic Convergence, Iroh tracked down Aang's children, Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin, after being informed by a Knowledge Seeker of their presence in the Spirit World. He offered to guide them out of the forest, though was declined, as Tenzin wanted to find his daughter, not a way out. Iroh expressed his sympathies for their loss, though urged them nonetheless to leave, as darkness threatened to take over the Spirit World since Vaatu had escaped. Understanding that Tenzin would not leave without Jinora, he cryptically said they had to be careful to not travel too deep into the Spirit World, lest they reached a place where only the lost could find them. Iroh and the Knowledge Seeker subsequently vanished, leaving his old friends to ponder his message, which Tenzin correctly deduced to be the Fog of Lost Souls.[42]\n" +

            "Sometime later, while searching for a new teapot to add to his collection, Iroh ended up at Xai Bau's Grove, where he found Korra, telling the Avatar that it was common in the Spirit World to find something or someone one did not know they were looking for. Noticing she looked troubled, he invited her to sit down and talk it over with him. He tried to ease her mind by pointing out that just because she was the Avatar, it did not have to mean that she needed to have all the answers. When she told him she wished she could talk to Aang, Iroh revealed that, despite their rough start, Zuko and Aang grew to be lifelong, best friends, prompting the Avatar to go back to the physical world to talk to his nephew.[43]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +

            "An easygoing man, Iroh usually had an upbeat demeanor.\n" +
            "Easygoing, open-minded, warm, wise, caring, generous, friendly, advising, kind, and humorous, Iroh treated his self-imposed exile during Zuko's search for the Avatar as though it were an extended vacation. Something of an epicurean in his old age, he did not devote his full energies to the pursuit of the Avatar, clashing with the dedication of his nephew.[44] However, beneath the easygoing exterior lay a wise man experienced in the ways of the world, a seasoned and wily strategist, and an incredibly strong and powerful firebending master.\n" +
            "Although he appeared hedonistic, Iroh's personal philosophies were ones of living life to the fullest, and following a path of one's own choosing. He was a firm believer that everyone had the power to create one's own destiny.[27] He appeared laid-back because he understood that there were things in life he could not control, but he also believed that a person is fully responsible for the parts they can. From Zuko's point of view, Iroh seemed lazy,[29] but from an objective point of view, it could be seen that he understood that Zuko was misguided. Throughout the last year of the Hundred Year War, Iroh constantly asked Zuko what it was that he wanted in life, asking him if capturing Aang was the destiny that he chose, or a path that others told him he needed to follow.[27] Iroh was a father figure to Zuko.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Iroh was particularly fond of tea, the strategy game Pai Sho, and music. He founded a music night for the ship's crew,[45] among whom he was popular, involving singing[21] and the playing of instruments.[46] He later displayed skill at playing the liuqin, singing lullabies to pacify a crying child.[11] He had shown himself to be an amateur botanist with knowledge of a wide variety of plants and their effects on the human body, though misinterpretation of some plant characteristics led him to accidentally poisoning himself.[47] Ginseng,[48] followed by jasmine, are pronounced to be his favorite teas.\n" +

            "Probably as definitive of Iroh's character as his love for tea was his sage advice and wisdom. Iroh was known by his niece and nephew for his sometimes cryptic proverbs and lengthy anecdotes. Throughout Books One and Two, Iroh constantly guided Zuko during his exile and critical, character-shaping decisions. He had also advised Aang[5] and Toph[10] to great effect.\n" +
            "Closely related to this wisdom was Iroh's affinity for spirituality. He constantly advocated maintaining the balance between elements, as demonstrated when he implemented waterbending techniques to divert lightning.[7] Iroh was the only character besides Aang who was able to see the spirit of Roku's dragon.[16] During the Siege of the North, Zhao also mentioned a rumor that Iroh had traveled to the Spirit World. Later in the battle, Iroh threatened Zhao for capturing the Moon Spirit and disturbing the balance of world, breaking his typical easy going manner.[8]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Iroh had no desire for power, not protesting when his brother took his birthright title of Fire Lord.[4] He soon retired from being a general, and stated that \"there is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity\".[27]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Though an honorable man, he was not above a spot of pilfering as he once pocketed perfumes from an abbey.[49] He also demonstrated respect and appreciation for all cultures, which seemed to be a rarity among those of the Fire Nation. This partially stemmed from his trip into the Spirit World, which left him with a certain spiritual awareness.\n" +

            "In dangerous and difficult situations, Iroh adopted a much more serious and determined persona.\n" +
            "Despite his age, Iroh could be quite the ladies' man when the need arose, often flirting with various women on his travels. Many of these were older women but some have been much younger, such as the bounty hunter June[49] and an Earth Kingdom peasant.[15] He was also addressed as \"handsome\" on multiple occasions.[50]\n" +
            "It had been hinted that Iroh may have been crueler in his days as a general before the death of his son. During a flashback, Iroh was shown, just after he had broken through the walls of Ba Sing Se, writing to Zuko, Azula, and Ursa. In his letter, he said he hoped they could see the city if he did not \"burn it to the ground first\".[4] On the way to Ba Sing Se years later he stated he \"was a different man\" when he laid siege to it.[26]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "It was unclear when Iroh traveled to the Spirit World and when he met the dragons and proved worthy to learn the original form of firebending, so it is not known if these experiences reformed Iroh into the man he became or if he was always a more peaceful man than his father and brother.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Iroh was shown to rarely show grudges, and did not seem to mind if people wronged him. This was made evident when a man attempted to mug him in Ba Sing Se; he did not fight back, but instead helped and gave advice to the mugger.[11]\n" +

            "Iroh was a firebending master, and arguably one of the most powerful firebenders of his time. It was mentioned that if Aang were to fail at defeating the Fire Lord, Iroh would be the only other person who could possibly defeat Ozai.[1] Iroh, like Jeong Jeong, knew its destructive and alluring power which could cause an amateur firebender to lose control. Instead of anger, Iroh based his bending style on the original firebending wisdom of the dragons and teachings of the Sun Warriors from whom he learned and whose secrets he kept. This philosophy emphasized the beauty and life-giving qualities of fire; thus, Iroh firebent without resorting to anger, hate, or lust, unlike his brother, niece and most other firebenders of his time. At the same time, he was able to show truly destructive power when provoked, able to blast through the inner wall of Ba Sing Se with a large and highly charged fire blast.\n" +
            "Iroh was highly knowledgeable and well-versed in most styles of firebending and their respective techniques. He was also a very capable teacher of the art, having personally trained his nephew, Zuko, in the majority of his high proficiency in firebending. He also stood as one of the select few firebenders of his time who possessed the ability to generate lightning.[7] This technique required perfect calmness of mind, but unlike his brother Ozai and niece Azula, Iroh derived this from inner peace instead of amorality.\n" +

            "Iroh redirects lightning\n" +
            "Iroh redirecting lightning from a storm.\n" +
            "Like his brother, he could easily perform it quickly and even during intense battle. Iroh's prowess for firebending also extended to creating his own original techniques. One of the techniques he invented was the absorption and redirection of lightning. Iroh invented this by observing the fluidity of waterbending moves and their ability to effectively redirect chi.[7] He used this move on multiple occasions, to redirect natural[18] as well as man-made lightning (the latter he even channeled before it was fully unleashed).[22]\n" +
            "While not exclusive to him, Iroh's signature technique was his fire-breath, a feat he could perform with especially potent power that earned him the nickname \"The Dragon of the West\".[5] He was able to maintain this technique in a sweeping manner against the Dai Li to give himself and Zuko enough time to escape from their clutches.[5]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Iroh had a tendency to not involve himself in battle,[45] but when he did partake, he displayed great skill, speed, agility, and ferocity. Even in his old age and while out of shape, he overwhelmed a group of four firebending guards accompanying Admiral Zhao within seconds, causing Zhao to retreat in fear,[8] and defeated multiple trained earthbenders in combat, using the chains that had previously subdued him.[16] He was also able to overpower, with notable ease, a full squad of Imperial Firebenders accompanying Azula as well as the prodigious princess herself.[22]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "His firebending skill may have developed even further after getting back in shape in prison.[30] He managed to break himself out of the jail, leaving only an enormous hole in the bars of his cell, and various scorch-marks on the walls. A shell-shocked Warden Poon described Iroh as being like a \"one-man army\".[33] During the coming of Sozin's Comet, Iroh displayed the true extent of his firebending prowess: he created a ring of fire around him and several other members of the Order of the White Lotus, expanding it and shrinking it with every breath, in and out. After a few breaths, he focused the ring around him into a ball, from which he launched a fire blast that breached the Inner Wall of Ba Sing Se itself.[36]\n" +

            "Iroh was a gifted strategist and tactician, having once been the Fire Nation's top general and next in line to become Fire Lord.[30] His craftiness was best showcased by his skill at Pai Sho.[45] His army won many battles in the Earth Kingdom and managed to break through the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se.[4][15] There were many who still referred to him as \"General\" Iroh, despite the fact that he had been retired for years, though Zhao did so in a partially sarcastic manner.\n" +
            "Iroh was a lover of music; he was a good singer, as well as a gifted pipa and tsungi horn player. He had knowledge of other cultures, and history. He was also something of an amateur botanist,[11] probably due to his love of tea, although this skill was not enough to save him getting poisoned, when he confused a rare tea plant with a poisonous one.[47] Because of his love of tea, Iroh was also an excellent tea maker, increasing business in the tea shop he and Zuko worked[2] in and was eventually awarded one of his own.[27] With his adept entrepreneurial skills, Iroh had managed to invent a new variety of tea, mixing tea with milk and tapioca pearls.[37]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Iroh was able to see the spirit of Aang riding Roku's dragon when no one else could.[16] He was also able to immediately discern that Princess Yue had been given life by the Moon Spirit.[8] His knowledge of the spirits and their world is immense, as he was later in life able to consciously depart his soul to the Spirit World, where he was welcomed.[14]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Iroh also demonstrated an impressive physical strength and skill in close combat without the usage of firebending. While imprisoned after the fall of Ba Sing Se, he spent most of his time performing intensive calisthenic routines without the guards' knowledge. In a few weeks, his previously overweight physique had completely changed to a slim yet impressively muscular one.[30] On the Day of Black Sun, while the scorch marks on the prison walls indicated part of his escape occurred before the eclipse began, he still escaped during the eclipse, when firebending was not possible.[33] This implied that Iroh had some knowledge of hand-to-hand combat to accomplish this feat. Interestingly, Iroh had planned to escape on the Day of Black Sun beforehand, implying he knew not only of this firebending weakness but also knew when an eclipse was going to occur, despite none of this information being public knowledge.\n";

That night, he stealthily approached Aang and his friends' campsite, but his metallic footsteps were detected by Toph. Eschewing stealth, Combustion Man attacked, his powerful bolts countered both Katara's waterbending and Toph's earthbending, forcing them to take cover. He followed Aang as the Avatar led him away from his friends. Following a running battle, Combustion Man's attacks were countered by Aang's airbending and earthbending, and he eventually had to halt his pursuit as the Avatar escaped on Appa with the rest of the group.[4]\n" +

He locked them in a wooden cell, depriving them both of earth and water to bend, and used them as nothing more than bait to lure in Aang, which proved successful. After Katara inventively used her sweat to waterbend and escape, the two girls arrived just in time to help Aang and Sokka, who had only narrowly avoided the ambush because Aang heard the assassin inhaling. Katara momentarily hampered his assassination attempt by freezing his head in a block of ice, allowing the group to escape. Toph launched a boulder at him to cover the group's escape, prompting him to destroy it. As the rock exploded, a single pebble flew off of the rock and struck him directly on his third eye tattoo, blocking his chi. He got up and attempted to shoot another explosion in the group's direction, only to find his ability hampered. The air around him detonated, sending him flying against a nearby wall, enabling the group to escape, much to his anger.\n" +

During the train ride, the assassin attacked the Avatar, preventing his escape by threatening the lives of the other passengers. The explosions caused the train to go faster and knocked out the engineer. After a short hand-to-hand confrontation, Aang convinced Combustion Man to face him atop the train, giving Sokka time to fix the engine.

Having shoved the prince aside and launched another attack against the group, he was threatened by Zuko that he would not receive any payment, an offer that quickly changed to the promise of double payment when he grabbed hold of the young firebender's shirt to hold him off. Combustion Man ignored these, however, appearing to attack for reasons other than money. Meanwhile, Zuko's antics proved to be a useful distraction for the group, who used the time to take cover. When Combustion Man resorted to blowing up pylons supporting the temple, Sokka took aim and used his boomerang to strike Combustion Man square on the forehead where his tattoo was, briefly stunning him and blocking his chi.

A rare style of firebending that allows him to trigger explosions from a third-eye tattoo on his forehead. This is done by channeling chi energy from his stomach, focused it into his forehead on a third-eye tattoo. This energy created thin transparent energy bolts that cracked like firecrackers as they traveled until exploding violently upon impact with a surface. This ability was mentally driven, requiring only inhalation and focus on his part, making his fighting style much less dynamic than standard firebending, and could be used at great ranges with considerable accuracy.[4] A single energy bolt was very powerful and could disintegrate large boulders or evaporate entire bodies of water with ease. The true degree of his power and skill was considerable, and in almost all encounters he overpowered everything Aang's group attacked him with. He was also capable of normal firebending, as he burnt a stolen message without forming an energy bolt,[4] but he always relied on his combustionbending during combat.\n" +

Ironically, his only known weakness involved his greatest weapon. By striking him on his third eye tattoo with even a pebble,[5] he will be temporarily stunned and, even more significantly, doing so will cause his bolts to backfire, the chi energy in the blast causing an explosion due to its inability to leave his body.

He was the second son of Azulon and Ilah, the younger brother of Iroh, uncle of Lu Ten, husband to Ursa, the father of Prince Zuko and Princess Azula,[3] and grandfather to Izumi.[4] Ozai was a firebending master and, prior to the ending of the War, was believed to have been one of the most powerful firebenders in the world.\n" +
            "After Iroh's only son, Lu Ten, died, Ozai usurped his brother's birthright to the throne[5] in a scheme that resulted in his father's death and Ursa's banishment.[6]\n" +
            "Ozai's rule saw a mass buildup of industry and significant technological advancements.[3] Like his father and grandfather before him, Ozai sought to conquer the other nations and become the supreme ruler of the world. To do this, he planned to utilize Sozin's Comet to burn down the Earth Kingdom, renouncing the title of Fire Lord and declaring himself the Phoenix King, ruler of the world.[7] Before his plans could come to fruition, he was defeated by Avatar Aang, who used energybending to remove his firebending abilities permanently.\n" +

            "After the end of the war and Zuko's crowning, Ozai was sentenced to life in prison for several war crimes.[8] However, he was able to maintain a degree of influence on world politics through some of his loyal followers creating the \"New Ozai Society\" and his son, who occasionally sought advice from Ozai. As a result, the former Fire Lord was indirectly responsible for the failure of the Harmony Restoration Movement.[1]\n" +

            "Ozai and his father sought to add Avatar Roku's lineage to the royal family, as the Fire Sages predicted that doing so would yield a more powerful bloodline. The two traveled to Hira'a and tracked down Ursa, the granddaughter of the past Avatar. After a short introduction by his father, Ozai proposed to Ursa and she agreed. However, when they prepared to travel back to the capital city, a commoner blocked their way, demanding to release Ursa. Azulon ordered their bodyguards to deal with him, but after a short struggle, Ursa pleaded with Ozai to call off his soldiers' attack, securing the man's safety, and let her talk to the man to get him to go home. After being called \"My Love\" by his future wife, the prince complied to the request. After the man was told off, the group continued their journey back to the capital.[1]\n" +

Much to her shock, he explained that she had to sever all ties to her past life in accordance with the old traditions, including family and friends, in order to completely devote herself to her new duties and the royal family. Ozai happily kissed Ursa, saying that she now belonged to him. After their wedding, they had two children together: Zuko and Azula.[1] However, when Zuko was born, his parents were not sure if he was a firebender, as he lacked \"that spark in [his] eyes\". Considering what a \"shame\" it would be for a prince of the Fire Nation to have a nonbender as firstborn, Ozai planned to cast his infant son from the palace. However, Ursa and the Fire Sages pleaded with Ozai to give Zuko a chance, and the prince eventually gave in.[10]\n" +
            "The young family made frequent vacations to Ember Island in order to relax. On a vacation around 87 AG, Zuko nearly drowned in an attempt to help a turtle crab. When the tides were pulling his son further into the sea, Ozai dove in the water and rescued Zuko, who spent the remainder of the day in the care of his mother, recovering from the experience. Ozai would later muse that he had attempted to be a good father in his children's early years.[1]\n" +

However, one day when he was training, the elderly woman came to him with a letter that she felt needed the prince's attention. After he read it, he yelled out the impossibility of the secret the writing contained, and crumpled the letter in his hand.[11]\n" +
            "Consumed by the information he had learned from Ursa's letter, he grew even more bitter toward his wife and oldest child. He called a Yuyan Archer, Vachir, to the palace and ordered him to travel to Hira'a in order to kill Ikem, Ursa's former boyfriend.\n" +

            "Ozai constantly reprimanded Zuko for his lousy firebending skills.\n" +
            "Months later, during a family dinner, Ozai listened to Azula's animated recollection of how she showed up her firebending teacher, Master Kunyo, much to the latter's displeasure. He sided with his daughter when she posed that Kunyo was wrong about how one creates the biggest fire blast, noting that he would send the firebending teacher to the colonies. When Zuko tried to speak in Kunyo's defense, however, Ozai snapped at his son, telling him he had no right lecturing Azula about firebending, considering that even though she was a year younger, she was already more advanced in the bending art. Ozai went on, telling him that he was not even sure that Zuko had been a bender at first, and that he had been lucky his mother and the Fire Sages had come to his rescue, as he had been planning to cast him over the palace wall for being a nonbending disgrace to him. He finished by telling Zuko that Azula \"never [had needed] that kind of luck\", and that \"[he had been] lucky to be born\". At that moment, a palace servant alerted Ozai to the return of Vachir, and Ozai promptly left the room.[10]\n" +

            "Ozai met Vachir on one of the palace balconies and listened to the Yuyan Archer's recollection of his adventures. The prince was informed that Vachir had failed to track down Ikem, as the man had disappeared in Forgetful Valley, where he was assumed to have perished on his own. Ozai, however, was not satisfied with this, deeming it all to be conjecture. He dismissed the archer, commanding him to resign from the Yuyan Archers, as his failure made him unsuitable to be part of the elite fighting group.\n" +
            "Afterward, Ozai went down to Ursa's quarters and confronted her about the letters she had sent Ikem, reminding her that she was supposed to forget her old life and that any communication with her past life was treasonous. Even though he deemed Zuko to be evidence of her treacherous act, he stated he would not kill the boy, proclaiming himself to be merciful. However, he took pleasure in informing his wife that he had sent an assassin after Ikem and that he had been successful, breaking her heart.[10] When Ursa told Ozai that Zuko was indeed their son, Ozai replied that he had already known that, as he had sent spies to keep an eye on Ursa months before their wedding, but was angry as to why she would write such an obvious lie. When Ursa replied that she wished for Zuko not to turn out like Ozai, the prince said he would be sure to treat their son like that \"of a treacherous dog\", and every time he would wound Zuko with harsh words, he would be \"fulfilling his mother's wish\".[12]\n" +

            "About eight years before Avatar Aang was found in the iceberg, Ozai's older brother Iroh began the six-hundred-day Siege of Ba Sing Se, the Earth Kingdom capital, which ended when Iroh's only son, Lu Ten, died in battle. This led Ozai to request that his father, Fire Lord Azulon, revoke Iroh's birthright as crown prince, allowing Ozai to inherit the throne instead of Iroh. Ozai explained that without an heir, the line of Fire Lords would end with Iroh, while Ozai still had two children. Azulon became furious, refusing to betray his firstborn son's right to the throne. As punishment, Azulon ordered Ozai to kill his own son, Zuko, so he would understand Iroh's pain.[5]\n" +

Knowing that Ozai would do anything, even kill his own son to become Fire Lord, she offered him a plan that would ensure his rise to the throne and spare the life of Zuko. The princess concocted an untraceable color- and odorless poison and turned it over to Ozai to do \"whatever [he wished]\". Ozai agreed to this on the condition that his wife would leave the palace, believing he too might otherwise be poisoned one day. Ursa tried to take Zuko and Azula with her, but Ozai assured her they would be safe in his hands as long as she kept her word, and threatened to hunt them all down should she try taking their children. Shortly thereafter, Ursa made the poison and turned it over to him, and he sneaked into Azulon's room that same night to end his father's life with it.[10]\n" +
            "The next morning, Azulon was found dead in his bed. His cremation took place a little later, and while Ozai and his two children were present, the Fire Sages announced Azulon's alleged dying wish; that Ozai would be his successor. The High Sage subsequently crowned the former prince Fire Lord, whereupon those present hailed him as their new ruler and bowed to him.[5]\n" +

            "Ozai entrusted Azula with a high priority mission.\n" +
            "Despite familial ties, Zuko bore the brunt of his father's cruelty. Two years prior to Aang's discovery at the South Pole, thirteen-year-old Zuko, his eldest and least favored child, spoke out in Ozai's war room against a general's plan to sacrifice novice troops in pursuit of victory. Angered by his impudence, Ozai demanded Zuko duel in an Agni Kai, not with the general whom Zuko had disrespected, but with Ozai himself. Seeing the Fire Lord in the arena, Zuko fell to his knees, pleading for forgiveness and refusing to duel his own father. For this perceived cowardice and disrespect, Ozai badly burned the left side of Zuko's face, permanently scarring him. He subsequently exiled Zuko from the Fire Nation, under orders not to return until he had done the impossible: capture the long-lost Avatar, who had been missing for nearly a hundred years.[5] This was meant to be an easy way of getting rid of Zuko, as all previous Fire Lords failed to find the Avatar. With the Avatar's sudden reappearance as the twelve-year-old airbender Aang,[9] Ozai became more aggressive in his pursuit of victory. Distrusting his son's competence, he promoted Zuko's rival Zhao from Commander to Admiral to increase his chances of capturing the Avatar.[13] Admiral Zhao was thwarted in his mission by Ozai's brother Iroh, who committed treason in an effort to stop Zhao from killing the Water Tribe's patron Moon Spirit. Ozai expressed distaste at what he saw as his brother's treachery and son's failure by giving his daughter, Azula, the task of capturing both Zuko and Iroh.[14]\n" +
            "After the successful Coup of Ba Sing Se,[15] Ozai had almost successfully taken control of the world. Eventually, he spoke with his son Zuko, who had regained his honor by supposedly \"killing\" the Avatar, and helping Azula to conquer Ba Sing Se.[16] This was the first and only time when Ozai felt proud of his son.[17]\n" +

            "Ozai announced to his generals his plan to utilize the power of Sozin's Comet to burn down the entire Earth Kingdom.\n" +
            "In a war meeting with his generals, the day before the eclipse, Ozai learned from Zuko that even though the Earth Kingdom had been officially conquered, its citizens would not accept defeat as long as they had hope. Following Azula's recommendation, Ozai concluded that the only way to end Earth Kingdom resistance was to use the power of Sozin's Comet to completely burn it to the ground, as had been done with the Air Nomads one hundred years before.[7]\n" +
            "During the eclipse on the Day of Black Sun, Ozai evacuated the Capital City[18] in preparation for the invasion and hid in a heavily guarded underground bunker. Zuko showed up and demanded permission to speak to his father. Ozai granted his request, amused that Zuko chose the eclipse to confront him. Zuko revealed that Azula shot down the Avatar and that she claimed he did it because the Avatar was in fact still alive. Ozai was infuriated and attempted to attack Zuko, but stopped when Zuko pulled out his dual dao swords against his father's disabled firebending. Zuko told him that he was done trying to earn his love, knowing that the very man who banished him and scarred him was not worthy of his love. Ozai said that it was to teach him respect, but Zuko denied this, saying it was cruel and wrong. Having had to learn everything on his own, Zuko now realized that the Fire Nation was unfit to rule the world and needed to return to harmony with the other nations. Ozai laughed at this declaration, remarking that Iroh had gotten through to him. Zuko went on to say that he would free Uncle Iroh from jail and help the Avatar defeat Ozai, prompting him to declare Zuko a full-blown traitor. Zuko refused to fight Ozai because he knew that fighting the Fire Lord was the Avatar's destiny, not his. Ozai, however, distracted Zuko by offering to tell him what really happened to his mother.[6]\n" +

            "Ozai revealed to Zuko that his father, Fire Lord Azulon, had indeed commanded Ozai to kill him, and that he would have done it had Zuko's mother not found out and interfered. She had proposed a plan to have Ozai spare Zuko's life by giving the throne over to Ozai through Azulon's downfall. However, Ursa \"committed vicious, treasonous things that night\" and was not killed, but banished as a result, making Zuko realize that she may still be alive. Ozai decided that \"banishment [was] far too merciful a penalty for treason\" and, sensing the eclipse outside had ended, tried to kill Zuko with a powerful display of lightning generation. However, he was not aware of Zuko's ability to redirect lightning, which Zuko used to send the bolt right back at Ozai, slamming him against the wall and leaving him to seethe in anger as Zuko fled the Fire Nation to join the Avatar.[6]\n" +

            "When Sozin's Comet arrived, Ozai crowned himself Phoenix King, the ruler of the world, and left Azula as his successor as Fire Lord.[7] He later departed with his fleet of Fire Nation airships for the Earth Kingdom to carry out his plans. When he reached the Earth Kingdom, he began his attack but was quickly repelled by Avatar Aang, who destroyed his airship.[19]\n" +
            "Battle at Wulong Forest\n" +
            "Main article: Battle at Wulong Forest\n" +
            "Ozai prepared to battle with the Avatar for control of the world, declaring that the universe had delivered Aang to him \"as an act of providence\", while his father, grandfather, and son had all failed to capture the Avatar. Aang asked Ozai to stop the Hundred Year War, but instead, Ozai began his attack.[19]\n" +
            "Energybending\n" +
            "While his life was spared by Aang, Ozai lost his firebending through the Avatar's use of energybending.\n" +
            "For much of the battle, Ozai had an advantage due to the power of Sozin's Comet enhancing his already powerful firebending. Aang was at a great disadvantage due to his unwillingness to harm or kill the Fire Lord. Eventually, Ozai overwhelmed and cornered Aang, whom he proceeded to mock for having such a peaceful nature and for being the last of his race.[19]\n" +
            "Determined to finish off the Avatar, Ozai accidentally unblocked Aang's seventh and final chakra, prompting him to enter the Avatar State. While in this state, Aang easily gained the upper hand. Using a combination of all four bending arts, Aang went on the offensive. Though he tried to defend himself, Ozai quickly realized he no longer had the upper hand, and was forced into a fighting retreat. Eventually, Aang caught up with him and pinned him down before preparing to deliver the final blow. Before it could be delivered, Aang regained control and voluntarily left the Avatar State, still not willing to kill Ozai to win. Instead, Aang used an ancient type of bending power, energybending, to strip Ozai of his firebending forever, ending the fight peacefully without any casualties. Sokka, Toph, and Suki later arrived and taunted Ozai, powerless and weary from Aang's new ability, calling him the \"Loser Lord\", \"Phoenix-King-of-Getting-His-Butt-Whooped\", and \"King of the ... Guys ... Who Don't Win?\", respectively.[8]\n" +

            "Ozai in prison\n" +
            "Upon his defeat, Ozai was left to ponder his actions in prison.\n" +
            "With the war over and Zuko crowned the new Fire Lord, Ozai was transported to the Capital City Prison, located near the Royal Palace, where Iroh was once held. Zuko later visited him, saying that his banishment set him on the right path, and that Ozai could use his time in prison to reflect on his actions, let go of his pride, and allow remorse to show him the path that Zuko spoke of. Fire Lord Zuko promptly demanded that Ozai state Ursa's whereabouts,[8] but he did not answer this question. Instead, he taunted Zuko about the stresses a Fire Lord could face while in office, and he expected Zuko to return soon to seek his help.[20] Following his imprisonment, most of Ozai's loyalists were removed from their offices by Zuko, minimizing his influence within the nation. However, some revisionists actively sought to reinstate Ozai as Fire Lord, including the \"New Ozai Society\",[21] though ultimately, these attempts failed.[22]\n" +
            "A year after the Hundred Year War, Ozai's prediction proved correct as Zuko returned to him seeking advice on how to rule the Fire Nation and still be able to sleep peacefully.[20] Enjoying the fact that his son came groveling back to him, Ozai told a story about Zuko's childhood where his son's indecisiveness over which animal he would save, a turtle crab from being eaten or a hawk from starvation, caused him to get into trouble when a wave washed him to sea. When Zuko did not understand why his father told him the story, Ozai simply dismissed the Fire Lord and ordered him to come back the next day with more tea.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Ozai&#039;s advice to Zuko\n" +
            "Ozai told Zuko of his belief that Kuei would strike Yu Dao, and that his son should defend the colony ferociously.\n" +
            "When Zuko returned with more tea, Ozai explained to him that the lesson to be learned from the memory was that there was no wrong or right in the world, as whatever the Fire Lord decided to do, was right by definition. When Zuko refused to see this and was set on going through with the peace talks with the Earth King, Ozai predicted that they would fail as the previously weak Earth King would be set on showing the world that he could be a strong and decisive ruler by leading his armies to the gates of Yu Dao. Zuko rejected Ozai's predictions again, which led the former firebender to the conclusion that Zuko trusted the Avatar more than he trusted himself. Sickened by this display of weakness from his own son, he demanded that Zuko leave his presence.[1]\n" +
            "After the solution of the Yu Dao crisis and the collapse of the Harmony Restoration Movement, Zuko again began his pursuit of information about Ursa's whereabouts. Because of Ozai's uncooperative behavior in this regard, Zuko requested help from his sister. Subsequently, Azula was placed in adjoining cells with her father, though they did not speak with each other for half an hour. When Zuko noticed that, he came to bring them tea, in an attempt to make the situation more enjoyable. Azula grabbed hold of the tray with her teeth, however, and subsequently made Zuko fall over. This scene caused Ozai to grin satisfied, but nevertheless, he remained silent. After a short struggle, Azula told her brother that she wanted her and their father to have a dignified conversation in private. To Ozai's surprise, Zuko gave in to this request. During their following conversation, Ozai told his daughter of his past with Ursa and her letters from Ikem, information that could serve as an opportunity for Azula to take the throne from Zuko.[11]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Several weeks later, Ozai was visited by Ursa in his prison. Angered by her appearance, he vowed to hurt her and everyone she loved. His threat left her unfazed, however, as she simply retorted that, while he tried to be \"big\", he had a small heart and no room for love for anyone, including himself. Ozai commanded her to grovel, but Ursa ignored him and left.[23]\n" +

            "Ozai found peace and kindness laughable concepts.\n" +
            "Ozai was easily angered, domineering, and insatiably power-hungry. It was implied that Ozai's deep-seated anger stemmed from a failed relationship with his own father, Fire Lord Azulon, though his indifference, militarism, and cruelty are nearly identical to Azulon's. Iroh noted several times that his brother was \"not the understanding type\",[24] and that he had never known Ozai to regret, forgive, or change his mind about anything.[25] Believing morality to be a sign of weakness, Ozai found peace and kindness laughable concepts and despised those who followed moral principles. As such, he possessed little to no empathy and rarely showed any interest in the feelings of others.[1][6]\n" +
            "This behavior was strongly influenced by his obsession with control and in order to achieve total control over the Fire Nation, Ozai was even willing to sacrifice his own family. When ordered by Azulon to kill Zuko so that he would know the pain of losing a son,[5] Ozai admitted to Zuko that he would have gladly carried out the murder had Ursa not interfered.[6] Eventually, he murdered his own father in order to usurp his brother's birthright and become Fire Lord.[10] Similarly, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his subordinates if that meant he would obtain more power. As a result, Ozai supported the idea of sacrificing new recruits to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion so he could get closer to controlling Ba Sing Se.[26] Likewise, he decided to use the power of Sozin's Comet to destroy the Earth Kingdom without standing still with the human loss that would mean.[7] Despite that, Ozai did believe that a Fire Lord's duty was to protect his people, though he reasoned that was because they were extensions of his divine will as Fire Lord; by attacking them, an opponent attacked him.[1] The ultimate expression of his obsession with control was his aspiration in life to conquer the entire world.[7]\n" +

            "When Zuko defied and escaped him, Ozai seethed with rage.\n" +

When Ursa begged him to spare her former lover, Ozai complied to the request after being called \"My Love\" by his future wife.[11] When he planned to cast his infant son from the palace, Ozai gave in after Ursa and the Fire Sages pleaded with him to give Zuko a chance.[10] Ozai believed that he attempted to be a good father in his early years,[1] a view shared by both Zuko and Azula.[11] However, his pride, anger, and lust for power degraded his relationship with his family. He believed skill and accomplishment determined worth, which allowed the naturally cunning and talented Azula to rise to the position of his favorite child, while he ignored or psychologically abused Zuko. He had no qualms about making Zuko's life miserable just to get back at Ursa for snapping at him that she wished that Zuko was Ikem's son, rather than his.[12] While his relationship with Zuko had always been tense, thenceforth Ozai began to torture Zuko with his perceived inferiority, saying that Azula was \"born lucky\", while he was \"lucky to be born\".[14] After his wife's banishment, he continued to be psychologically abusive toward both of his children and physically abusive toward his son. When Zuko was thirteen, Ozai burned his face and banished him from his country, simply because Zuko spoke out of turn during a war meeting,[26] an action for which he never showed any remorse[12] and merely claimed it to have been a lesson in respect.[6] He only acknowledged Zuko when he helped his sister conquer Ba Sing Se and when he \"killed\" the Avatar.[16] Eventually, Ozai attempted to kill Zuko when the latter announced his intent to join the Avatar, thereby defying his father.[6] On the other hand, Ozai raised Azula to become his future heir, expecting nothing less than the best from her,[5] which placed a great amount of stress on her and forced her to become a perfectionist.[25] Ultimately, it was the environment in which Ozai raised Azula, where fear, power, and perfection were the only reliable truths, that set the groundwork for her total mental collapse.[19]\n" +
            "However, despite his behavior toward his children, Ozai appeared to be remarkably forgiving of failure for certain people, such as War Minister Qin[6][27][28] and Zhao, who retained their positions and, in Zhao's case, was repeatedly promoted,[13] despite repeated failures and bungles. Nonetheless, he saw his subordinates as expendable and replaceable, having no tolerance for those who failed to impress him, such as Kunyo or Vachir.[10]\n" +

            "Although still domineering, Ozai became more logical and calm after losing his bending.\n" +
            "After being stripped of both his bending and his throne, Ozai apparently still retained his domineering personality, as he casually lectured Fire Lord Zuko when he came to visit Ozai in jail. However, he would develop a calmer, more logical attitude toward life as he thought that Aang's belief of maintaining the four separate nations would only halt progress. This is apparently true as Yu Dao, a city that combined the effort from citizens of both the Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom, grew from a small village to a very developed area. As Zuko sought out Ozai for advice, through their discussions, it was revealed that Ozai believed that good and evil, and even strength and weakness, were meaningless concepts. He believed that the only right and wrong were what he, or more accurately, the Fire Lord, decided, due to his divine right to rule. Any choice he made was the right one, simply by virtue of it being his choice, and that indecisiveness and attempts to guide oneself by moral principles were signs of weakness, traits he despised in Zuko.[1]\n" +

            "Firebending\n" +
            "Ozai&#039;s enhanced firebending\n" +
            "Ozai's firebending abilities were fueled by hatred and rage.\n" +
            "Fire Lord Ozai was a powerful and skilled firebender; it was stated by Zuko that if the Avatar were unable to defeat him, the only other individual capable of doing so would be Iroh, who even expressed uncertainty in being able to defeat his brother in an Agni Kai.[29] His fighting style was extremely liberal and stressed overbearing, infernal force. It was clearly fueled by anger, hatred, and personal gain.\n" +
            "Before he was crowned Fire Lord, he practiced his bending by attacking a series of dummies, firing relatively potent, yet normal blasts of fire.[11] He later ferociously attacked his son with a two-handed lightning strike, which he performed with great speed and ease with the sun still being at its lowest point after not yet having emerged fully from the eclipse.[6]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In his final battle with the Avatar, under the influence of the comet, the former Fire Lord revealed the extent of his firebending powers, creating some of the largest known plumes of fire. During this battle he also assaulted Aang with lightning and demonstrated great mastery as well as an unorthodox use of firebending for high-speed propulsion and flight.[19] He went toe-to-toe against Aang, who had the four elements at his disposal and also benefited from the comet's firebending-enhancing energies. However, despite a fierce struggle from Ozai, he was outmatched and overpowered by an Avatar State-empowered Aang, who proceeded to remove his bending powers forever as an alternative to killing him.[8]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Despite his extremely ruthless and domineering attitude, Ozai was implied on a few occasions to be a respected if not loved Fire Lord to his people, displaying great leadership, intelligence, charisma and courage. This was most notably demonstrated when Mayor Morishita of Yu Dao compared Ozai with his son one year after the end of the war, concluding that Ozai was a better, more patriotic leader.\n" +
            "Ozai surviving impact\n" +
            "Ozai had strong physical durability, so much so that he was able to survive a brutal impact into a stone pillar after an Avatar State-enhanced wind blast.\n" +
            "Even during his imprisonment, Ozai displayed a knack for manipulation, as he attempted to take advantage of Zuko's doubts over the pressure of being Fire Lord and goad him into following in his footsteps. Ozai gained a calmer, more logical attitude in prison, displaying great wisdom and a way of thinking ahead of his time, being one of the first to note that the concept of separate nations was halting progress, and was in favor of a union of the various nations.\n" +
            "Aside from his bending, Ozai also possessed strong physical abilities. During his final battle against Aang, he managed to endure an Avatar State-enhanced wind blast that sent him flying into a stone pillar with enough force to crack it, and recovered from the attack to continue the fight. He also had quick reflexes and a fast reaction time, as he managed to evade and defend himself against the Avatar's barrage of elemental attacks, despite its overwhelming speed, range, and power\n";

Before her rise to power, she was a prominent member of the Metal Clan, serving as both the captain of the Zaofu's guard and part of Suyin Beifong's dance troupe.[5] Following the outbreak of anarchy in the Earth Kingdom, Kuvira left the Metal Clan and earned the trust of the world leaders by stabilizing Ba Sing Se and was appointed as the nation's provisional leader.[6] She subsequently set out to reunite the rest of the kingdom with her army, which earned her the title of \"Great Uniter\". In her pursuit of order, Kuvira offered to protect the nation's states from bandits in exchange for their loyalty.[2] During Prince Wu's coronation, Kuvira denounced the authority of the Earth King and dissolved the Earth Kingdom in favor of an \"Earth Empire\" under her leadership.[7] Her reign came to an end, however, after she was defeated in Republic City and imprisoned.[1] She was also engaged to Baatar Jr., who left Zaofu with her to support her ideals,[2] though ended their relationship when she was willing to sacrifice him to have a chance to end Avatar Korra's life.[8]\n" +

            "Being abandoned by her parents,[1] Kuvira was taken in by Suyin Beifong when she was eight years old, who nurtured her talents and, over time, came to regard her as a daughter.[6] Growing up, she became heavily influenced by Suyin's progressive ideology concerning modernization and self-fulfillment.[9] A smart and natural leader, Kuvira quickly rose through the ranks of Zaofu's security team, eventually becoming captain of the city's guard. She also was a part of Suyin's dance troupe.[10]\n" +

            "Kuvira ordered Zaheer and his associates to surrender and release Avatar Korra.\n" +
            "Several days later, Kuvira accompanied Suyin's family and Team Avatar to a rooftop where they bade farewell to Opal, who left Zaofu to for airbending training at the Northern Air Temple. After the airbender's airship left the city, Kuvira used her radio to command the other guards to begin securing Zaofu for the evening. Later that night, Kuvira attacked Zaheer and his group after the four managed to infiltrate the city in an attempt to kidnap Korra. She helped the other members of the Metal Clan trap the criminals in a makeshift metal prison, before ordering them to surrender and return the Avatar. Following the group's escape, Kuvira and the other guards searched the city, albeit to no avail, as they were unable to find any traces of the four benders.\n" +
            "Kuvira was questioned by Aiwei, along with the rest of the city's guards, in an attempt to determine the identity of Zaheer's accomplice. When Aiwei's involvement in the attempted kidnapping of Avatar Korra came to light, Kuvira was ordered by Lin Beifong to search the city for the truth seer and determine where the tunnel underneath his home led, which she eventually traced to a dead end with no signs of Aiwei.[5]\n" +

            "Kuvira traveled with Team Avatar, their allies, and several other members of the Metal Clan to the Northern Air Temple in an attempt to free the airbenders held captive by the Red Lotus. Adhering to Zaheer's demand to meet Korra alone at Laghima's Peak, Kuvira went with Suyin, Lin, Tonraq, and the other metalbenders to the base of the peak and started climbing the mountain with their metal cables in order to be ready to aid Korra if it became necessary. After Mako alerted Lin that they had been double-crossed, the group hurried to the top, though as soon as Kuvira emerged, she was blown off the peak by one of P'Li's combustion beams. Using her cables, she managed to save herself and rejoined the other metalbenders atop the cliff, where they attempted to subdue P'Li. In the midst of the battle that ensued, Kuvira used her cables to save Tonraq after Zaheer used airbending to throw the waterbender off the mountain.\n" +

            "Kuvira tended to Tonraq's injuries after an altercation with Zaheer and P'Li.\n" +
            "Following the fight, the group reassembled at the base of the peak, where Kuvira tended to Tonraq's wounds. While bandaging the tribal chief's arm, Kuvira introduced herself by name after the waterbender thanked her for her help and addressed her by her rank. She requested to accompany Suyin and the members of Team Avatar to a series of caves near the temple in order to rescue the missing airbenders, but was ordered by Suyin to remain with the injured, much to her disappointment.[11]\n" +

            "A few weeks after the insurrection of the Red Lotus, Kuvira was present during a meeting between President Raiko, Tenzin, and Suyin, as they hoped the latter would take their offer to reunite the Earth Kingdom. When Suyin declined, Kuvira urged the matriarch to reconsider, believing it to be their opportunity to share Zaofu's progressive ways with the rest of the nation. Even though the Zaofu matriarch explained that they would be seen as conquerors and only greeted with war, Kuvira reasoned that there were already wars and by becoming involved, they had the opportunity to change things. Suyin remained adamant in declining, which caused a rift between the two women and Kuvira secretly collaborated with Baatar Jr. to devise a way to get out of the city and stabilize Ba Sing Se. She persuaded Varrick, a large part of the city's security force, and a few of its wealthiest citizens to accompany her. As they were preparing the airships for departure, Suyin confronted her protÃ©gÃ©e, who boldly told her that they were leaving Zaofu to restore order in the Earth Kingdom. Threatened to be banished from the city if they were to leave, Kuvira remained unfazed, declaring that when she chose to return, it would be on her own terms. They left for Ba Sing Se and managed to stabilize the capital, an action that earned Kuvira the trust of the world leaders, who appointed her as the nation's provisional leader.[6] During her quest to reunite the kingdom, she assembled a massive army, which included modernized airships, mecha suits, and other tanks. With a high-speed maglev train, Kuvira traveled to states overrun by bandits and bargained with their leaders, offering protection and supplies in return for their allegiance to her.[2] However, after stabilizing the town, she forced the citizens to slave labor in order to serve her war effort and sent off dissenters to reeducation camps,[6] as well as citizens not of native Earth Kingdom origin.[12] At some point, she also started a romantic relationship with Baatar Jr., with whom she eventually got engaged.[2]\n" +

            "After single-handedly defeating twenty bandits, Kuvira forced them all to pledge their loyalty to her.\n" +
            "By 174 AG, Kuvira had united ninety percent of the states of the Earth Kingdom. When Varrick ordered Zhu Li to provide everyone with some celebratory tea, Kuvira declined the beverage, vowing to celebrate only when her mission was completed in entirety, causing Varrick, Zhu Li, Bolin, and Baatar Jr. to hold off on their own drinks. When the train suddenly halted, she demanded to know the reason and was informed that the tracks were blocked by a pile of rocks left by bandits. Although troops had been deployed to handle the situation, Kuvira ordered their retreat as she wanted to handle the situation herself. She exited the train atop its roof from where she watched the bandits descend the cliffs on either side of her vehicle. Kuvira easily evaded or deflected the rocks aimed at her and, as soon as her opponents came within striking distance, she retaliated by launching a series of metal strips which she used to cover her opponents' eyes and restrict their limbs. After subduing all of her attackers and binding them to the train tracks, Kuvira removed the metal strips covering their eyes and addressed the earthbenders, whom she berated for causing chaos where she was attempting to restore order. When a female bandit started to apologize, Kuvira silenced her by covering her mouth momentarily with a metal strip to prevent the woman from interrupting her. When a male bandit begged for mercy, she ordered them to stop groveling over their predicament and offered them the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and serve as productive members of the Earth Kingdom, vowing to give them a new purpose in life in return for their loyalty to her. If they refused her offer, she threatened to leave them stuck to the tracks, prompting the prisoners to pledge their loyalty and join her army, much to her satisfaction.\n" +
            "Opal confronting Baatar Jr.\n" +
            "Kuvira tried to mediate between Baatar Jr. and an angry Opal.\n" +
            "After arriving at the capital of the state of Yi, Kuvira was pleased to see Opal and Bolin reunite, remarking that they were her favorite couple. After Opal snapped at Baatar Jr. that he had betrayed their mother, Kuvira urged the airbender to let go of what happened three years prior, remarking that she and her army were there solely to help the state recover. She acknowledged that rumors of her conquering towns may paint her in a negative light, but assured Opal that she was only concerned in providing a better future for the Earth Kingdom people by laying the groundwork for citizens to achieve their own greatness. After revealing that she and Baatar Jr. were engaged, she asked Opal to forgive and forget the troubles that occurred between her and the Beifong family three years prior. Their conversation was cut short, however, when Kuvira was asked by the governor of Yi what she was doing there, upon which she requested a private audience with the man on her train.\n" +
            "Kuvira berates the governor\n" +
            "Kuvira berated the governor of Yi for refusing to sign her contract, remarking that his pride would not be enough to protect his people or his state.\n" +
            "Alone inside her train, Kuvira asked the governor if he had time to rethink her offer, which she deemed to be generous. When the governor opposed the generosity of it all, she pointed out that the bandits outnumbered his people and out-supplied his state, making it only a matter of time until Yi would succumb. By signing her deal, she would save the lives of the people of Yi as well as keep the governor in position under her supervision, which was something that she deemed to be generous. She was refused once more, however, and accused of only wanting access to Yi's ore reserves, which prompted Kuvira to reprimand the governor for his pride, which would be ineffective to protect Yi against bandits and to feed the people. Despite her efforts, the governor refused to yield and Kuvira ordered her troops to head out. Upon asked what had happened, Kuvira explained that she was unable to make a deal with the governor. As she moved to retreat into the train, Kai asked if they were not going to stay and help, which prompted Kuvira to hand him the contract, saying that she and her army would remain stationed at the state border for a day and if he could get the governor to sign the document, she would provide all the help Yi needed.\n" +
            "Conquering the State of Yi\n" +
            "Kuvira declared the state of Yi to be under her protection.\n" +
            "Kuvira returned to the state capital after the governor acquiesced and signed the contract, immediately deploying soldiers and modernized mecha suits as well as distributing parcels of food. She declared that Yi was under her army's full protection before turning to the governor and forcing him to pledge his allegiance to her if he wished to keep his position.[2]\n" +
            "Establishing the Earth Empire\n" +
            "A day before Prince Wu's coronation as the fifty-fourth earth monarch, Kuvira and her army arrived at Republic City. With a select group of officers, she made her way to the Republic City Four Elements hotel, where she was greeted by some of her fans, asking her for an autograph. As the children retreated with their signed paper, Kuvira was approached by Wu, who complimented her appearance. She remained unfazed by his flirtatious manners and declined his offer to talk to the hotel clerks on her behalf to receive a nicer room, informing the prince that she had already reserved the Presidential Suite. It was only when the prince laughed her comment away, stating that he was staying in that room, that she turned to look at him and amusedly told the royal that she had him moved. As Wu grew disheartened over the prospect of staying in a junior suite, Kuvira commented that she always got what she wanted.\n" +
            "Kuvira crushes\n" +
            "Kuvira crushed the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom she had been given by Earth King Wu to emphasize what the Earth Empire under her rule would do to those who opposed them.\n" +
            "The next day, Kuvira was seated next to the world leaders to attend Wu's coronation as king. She was called forth by the new king and received the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom for her efforts to restabilize the nation. Being allowed to give a speech, she stated that she had learned by growing up in Zaofu with Suyin Beifong that the idea of a hereditary monarchy was archaic and technology and innovation should be the thriving factors of a nation. Blaming the continuous rule of unsuitable monarchs for the state of disarray in the Earth Kingdom, she declared that it had taken her three years to get the nation stabilized and would refuse to let it descend into chaos once again. She denounced Wu's authority and dissolved the Earth Kingdom, appointing herself as the leader of what she now called the \"Earth Empire\", intending to bring about a new era of prosperity for her people. Warning the world leaders not to cross her, she emphasized her words by ripping off and crushing the medal she had been given. She received a standing ovation from a cheering crowd for her words.\n" +
            "Upon returning to the Presidential Suite, Kuvira noticed that Bolin looked worried and approached him. Hearing about him having misgivings about how she ambushed the world leaders, she implored him to stand by her since he believed in the work they had done thus far, adding that she would need him more than ever as the world leaders would try to force them to accept Wu's reign, who would not serve the people. She assured him that her threat to crush her opponents was merely tough rhetoric to make everyone understand that they were not to be fooled with, as conflict was the last thing she wanted. She requested his help to make history, which led him to reaffirm his loyalty to her cause.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Suyin and Kuvira\n" +
            "Kuvira rebuffed Suyin's attempts to make her relinquish power and warned her former mentor of what was to become of Zaofu if she continued to resist her.\n" +
            "When Suyin entered to room, stating she and Kuvira needed to talk, the military leader asked Bolin to leave the room. She criticized the matriarch of Zaofu for her passive attitude toward the consequences of Queen Hou-Ting's death. As Suyin defended herself by saying that she merely did not want to seize power for herself like Kuvira had done and that it was beneficial for the good if she would step down, Kuvira rebuffed her statement, pointing out that she was the one who provided stability and equality and that they would not accepted Wu's reign, whom she referred to as the \"world leaders' hand-picked dictator\". Upon being told that she was a dictator herself due to what she had done to cities which refused to capitulate to her, Kuvira warned Suyin that the same would be coming for Zaofu.\n" +
            "As Kuvira and her army left Republic City on her train, she watched as Varrick began to experiment on a hunk of spirit vine, telling him the development of this new technology was his number one priority.[7] She mobilized her army and headed toward Zaofu with the intent of conquering the last territory not under her control.[13]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Annexing Zaofu\n" +
            "While her army had already arrived at the gates of Zaofu and set up camp, Kuvira was still underway with her maglev train. En route, she cautioned Baatar Jr. to not get ahead of himself by stating that by the same time the following day, Suyin would have signed the treaty that surrendered Zaofu to their control, as she knew that securing the metal city would not be as easy as he made it seem. When her fiancÃ© declared to be ready to take the city by force, she reeled him in once more, stressing the importance of handling the situation with diplomacy, as the eyes of the world were upon them. She wished to use Bolin for that task, since Suyin trusted him and she hoped that the matriarch would listen to him.\n" +
            "Kuvira threatens Varrick\n" +
            "Kuvira threatened to kill Varrick by dropping him on the tracks if he refused to continue working on weaponizing the spirit vine energy.\n" +
            "When a shock rattled their train, Kuvira and Baatar Jr. swiftly made their way down to the last cart where Varrick was conducting his experiments on spirit vines and inquired if they were attacked. She was reassured by the inventor that they had merely been \"spirit vined\" and that she did not need to worry about that as he would terminate the project. She ordered him to continue, asking if he realized what they would be able to achieve with such power, though that was the reason why he wanted to stop the experiment. As he went on about having developed a conscience, Kuvira notified him that she was the other voice in his head that ordered him to continue. When Varrick once again adamantly refused, she metalbent his metal shoulder plates and dangled him out of the back of the train, threatening to drop him on the tracks. After Varrick quickly reconsidered his stance on the project, she hauled him back in and roughly threw him down on the metal floor. Ostentatiously stepping over him, she retreated back to her own cart with her fiancÃ©, while placing the inventor under military supervision.\n" +
            "Back in her own wagon, Kuvira summoned Bolin and told him that they had selected him to be part of their inner circle. She explained that Suyin's resentment toward her and Baatar Jr. would prevent the matriarch from joining their cause and truly reunite the Earth Empire. As such, it was her hope that Bolin would be able to convince Suyin on their behalf. Upon being asked about the army's presence at the gates of Zaofu, Kuvira dismissed it as merely being a projection of strength, whereas Bolin was there to present peace.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Suyin opposes Kuvira\n" +
            "As Suyin denounced her authority, Kuvira gave the Zaofu matriarch a twenty-four hour deadline to surrender.\n" +
            "Arriving at Zaofu, Kuvira and Bolin were led by Baatar Jr. to the room where the rest of the Beifong family was awaiting them. As Suyin declared that she was not giving up Zaofu, despite of all the military presence, Kuvira tried to reassure the matriarch that the troops were merely there to show what she and Baatar Jr. had accomplished. Tensions rose, however, when Kuvira dryly laughed away Suyin's suggestion that she had brainwashed Baatar Jr., angrily snapping back that she had merely set him free and that he had already accomplished more with her than he could have ever done if he had stayed in Zaofu. Although Bolin tried to defuse the situation, he was ignored and Kuvira was ordered by Suyin to leave, as Zaofu would never accept her as their leader. Unfazed, she gave the matriarch a twenty-four hour ultimatum to join the empire peacefully or they would take it by force.\n" +
            "Back in the army camp, upon being asked if she truly intended to invade Zaofu, Kuvira revealed to Bolin that it was only natural for them to find \"other ways\" for people to join if they refused to cooperate. She did not elaborate on what those ways were, dismissing them to be not of importance to him, and merely stated that the citizens of the annexed states were her loyal subjects, whom she could order around as she saw fit. As part of their inner circle, she made it clear that there were some hard truths that he just needed to accept without questions. Upon hearing Bolin's suggestion that they should just leave Zaofu, as that would mean that the Earth Empire would already be united, Kuvira grew angry, blaming him to love Opal more than he was loyal to her, and threatened to ship him off to a reeducation camp. Although he affirmed his loyalty to her, Kuvira remained skeptical.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Kuvira and Korra\n" +
            "Kuvira urged Korra to convince Suyin to give Zaofu up to prevent a military battle.\n" +
            "Later, when Kuvira was talking to two of her sergeants, she was approached by her fiancÃ© and Korra. She warmly greeted the Avatar, stating it was an honor to meet her again and that it was wonderful news that she had recovered from her ordeal with Zaheer. However, when Korra made it clear that she was there to ask the army commander to back down, Kuvira stated that they both knew she would not follow through on that request. Upon being told that she could not claim Zaofu without any resistance from the Avatar, she calmly stated that she was tasked to bring unity to the Earth Kingdom and failed to see why she should treat Zaofu, the last holdout, differently from any other state. She understood that Korra was doing Suyin a favor, though opposed the intrusion on her quest of reuniting the nation. She pointed out that the world had been descending into chaos while Korra was gone and that she had been forced to make some tough decisions to get it back on track. Since Korra could sympathize with the feeling of having people mad due to a decision made, Kuvira asked the Avatar to try to convince Suyin into giving up the city. In order to facilitate the talks, she called a temporary truce which would last until Korra got back to her with Suyin's decision.\n" +
            "By dusk, Bolin, Zhu Li, and Varrick were presented to Kuvira in her personal tent after being caught deserting the army. She ordered them all to be shipped out on the first train, sending Bolin and Zhu Li to the reeducation camp for their most stern dissenters, while placing Varrick under military, armed supervision to continue his spirit energy experiments. When Zhu Li begged her to have mercy, pledging her allegiance and her life to the army commander, Kuvira reconsidered the assistant's fate and gave her another change, pointing out to the two men that they could learn a lot from the woman.[6]\n" +

            "Having predicted Suyin's sneak attack, Kuvira had set up a trap.\n" +
            "That night, Kuvira had the feeling that Suyin would attempt an attack on her and thus ordered Zhu Li to sleep in her bed instead. Her suspicions proved to be correct when the Zaofu matriarch and her twin sons infiltrated her tent and captured Zhu Li. When the walls of her quarters fell back and revealed to the intruders that they had walked into a trap, Kuvira chastised Suyin for being a coward, noting that she believed the Zaofu matriarch had always been afraid; afraid to step up and lead the Earth Kingdom, afraid to join her when she became the leader, and afraid to face her in a fair fight. She ordered her men to arrest the intruders and subsequently used Zaofu's internal communication system to announce for the entire city that Suyin, Wei, and Wing had been arrested. As an act of mercy, she stated that she would not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu if the remaining representatives would meet her at dawn and offer her the full and unconditional surrender of the city.\n" +
            "Smug Kuvira\n" +
            "Confident in her own abilities, Kuvira challenged Korra to a one-on-one battle for the fate of Zaofu.\n" +
            "At dawn, Kuvira stood in front of her entire, battle-ready army, where she was approached by Korra, Opal, and Jinora, who served as the representatives of Zaofu. When Opal ordered her to release her family, Kuvira stated that she would make sure no harm befell the Beifong clan if Suyin would bow to her, though the matriarch quickly made it clear that she was not going to do so. Upon being asked if there was a way to resolve the brewing conflict, she reiterated that she had already laid out her terms, which she deemed to be reasonable. As Opal inquired after Bolin's whereabouts, Kuvira let the airbender believe that he completely supported her actions. Having had enough of the talks, she ordered the surrender of Zaofu, though when Korra objected, Kuvira chastised the Avatar for interfering in internal Earth Empire business and letting her personal feelings cloud her judgment. She stated that Zaofu had been hoarding its riches and technology for too long and could no longer continue to rule itself, explaining her plans to distribute the city's resources fairly across the rest of the empire. Upon hearing Opal urge Korra to take her down, Kuvira made it clear to the Avatar that the only way she could be stopped was if Korra physically forced her. Hearing Korra say that she had left her no choice, Kuvira addressed her army, stating that would never ask them to do anything that she was not willing to do herself. As such, she challenged Korra to a one-on-one duel for the fate of Zaofu: if Korra won, she would leave Zaofu to her, though if she won, the Avatar needed to stay out of Earth Empire business.\n" +
            "Kuvira is victorious\n" +
            "Kuvira declared her victory over Korra and her dominion over Zaofu.\n" +
            "As Korra accepted the challenge, Kuvira told her that she could use every element at her disposal, as well as the Avatar State, baiting the younger woman by stating that she knew the Avatar was a \"little rusty\". Although Korra fiercely charged her, barraging her with elemental attacks, Kuvira managed to keep the upper hand with her agility, swift changes between metal and earth attacks, and fast counter strikes. After knocking Korra down a few times and tossing her over the battle field, Kuvira was pushed back when Korra entered the Avatar State, delivering two swift and powerful airbending blows. Dazed, the army commander looked up at as the Avatar rode an airspout and levitated a large boulder with which she intended to crush her. Korra fell out of the Avatar State, however, when she was beset by another hallucination in which Kuvira's face was substituted with her own with the eyes aglow, allowing Kuvira to capture Korra by the wrists with two metal strips and levitate her in the air. Slamming her down on the ground and rendering her unconscious, Kuvira encased Korra in an earth shell and bent six metal strips into sharp razors with which she intended to finish the Avatar. Before she could do so, however, she was blown back by Opal and Jinora. Helped up to her feet again by two soldiers, Kuvira order her army to attack, since the airbenders' intervention had broken their agreement. Her soldiers failed to reach the women due to a powerful whirlwind, though they forced them to flee Zaofu on Pepper, which prompted Kuvira to announce that Zaofu was theirs, officially reuniting the Earth Empire.\n" +
            "Imprisoned Wei, Wing, and Suyin\n" +
            "Kuvira presented an imprisoned Suyin, Wei, and Wing and brandished them as traitors.\n" +
            "Inside Zaofu, Kuvira ordered the citizens to kneel before her. If they did so, she promised to let them have their freedom and deal with them fairly as citizens of the Earth Empire. If they were to refuse to pledge their loyalty to her, she would imprison them as traitors, presenting an imprisoned Suyin, Wei, and Wing to emphasize that she was not idly threatening them. After Baatar and Huan were the only two to refuse to acknowledge her, she retreated to the Beifong family's personal garden, where she played around with a meteorite while Baatar Jr. reported to her that Varrick and Bolin had perished in the explosion that also destroyed the spirit vine technology. She was reassured by her fiancÃ©, however, the he could replicate the technology if he had an assistant, upon which she appointed Zhu Li to help him. She also ordered Baatar Jr. to commence dismantling the domes that protected Zaofu,[14] in order to fashion an enormous mecha suit to carry transport her spirit energy cannon,[8] and issued wanted posters of Bolin and Varrick, despite her fiancÃ©'s assurance that they had perished.[12]\n" +
            "Readying the spirit weapon\n" +
            "Kuvira later took her air fleet toward the Foggy Swamp. Making her way to the banyan-grove tree, she was informed by Baatar Jr. that the roots there contained even more spirit energy than the vines procured in Republic City. As such, she ordered her battalion of mecha suits to harvest all the roots they could find.[12]\n" +
            "Weeks later, Kuvira traveled toward one of her factories near Zaofu to inspect the progress made on the spirit energy cannon. As Baatar Jr. reported that they had encountered some malfunctions, she turned to Zhu Li and asked the assistant what she thought the problem was, since she had been working on the project from the start. Being told that problems were normal with a machine from such complexity, Kuvira verified with the woman that she was truly doing everything that she could to fix them. Satisfied with Zhu Li's affirmation, she ordered all the troops and factory workers to be present at the cannon's demonstration the next day.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Kuvira and Zhu Li\n" +
            "Discovering Zhu Li's sabotaging of the spirit energy cannon, Kuvira confronted her and sentenced her to die during the first test of the weapon.\n" +
            "The following day, Kuvira congratulated the gathered people on their hard work and declared the spirit energy cannon to be proof of the Earth Empire being the strongest nation of the world. As the troops cheered for her, she ordered Baatar Jr. to fire the cannon. When the machine malfunctioned again and Baatar Jr. pointed out that a missing distributor pin could cause the machine to explode, Kuvira turned to Zhu Li and asked what she knew of it all. Not convinced with the assistant's answer that she knew of nothing, she metalbent the missing pin out of Zhu Li's uniform. Kuvira angrily berated Zhu Li for her betrayal after she had been given a chance. As Zhu Li denounced her to be a monster, Kuvira sentenced her to be chained to a tower in the abandoned town that was the target of the cannon, where she would be the first victim of the spirit weapon.\n" +
            "Kuvira versus Suyin\n" +
            "In a one-on-one battle with Suyin, Kuvira eventually managed to overpower her old mentor.\n" +
            "When the alarm of the factory blared moments later, Kuvira immediately deduced it was triggered by the imprisoned Beifong family. She ordered some of her soldiers to hurry down to the prison, while telling Baatar Jr. to continue his work on repairing the cannon as she desired to see the target town be destroyed. When he fired the weapon, she grew angry upon finding the trajectory of the beam distorted by the Beifong family, who had used their earthbending to momentarily knock the cannon off balance. Kuvira narrowly missed the rock Suyin launched at her head by rolling out of the way. The two metalbenders started to barrage each other with small, metal strips, each alternating between offensive and defensive maneuvers. Kuvira was caught off guard when Suyin bent one of the metal containers atop the cannon to her, though she managed to hurl it over the side and out of her way. Seeking revenge, Kuvira used the metal bands over her a left bicep to fashion a sword and launched herself toward her former mentor, who only narrowly avoided being struck. When Suyin intercepted one of her trusts, Kuvira was tossed over the side of the cannon. She managed to hold on, however, by bending the tip of her blade into a hook and swing herself underneath the railing and into Suyin, knocking her down. Bending her sword into a whip, Kuvira caught Suyin's left wrist and smacked her down, proceeding to immediately propel the older woman against the loading barrel of the cannon, before launching her off the machine altogether. Kuvira subsequently watched how her soldiers gained the upper hand against Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing, though was shocked to see her force defeated by one attack of Toph, who accused her of giving metalbenders a bad name. Kuvira watched as the Beifong family, Bolin, and Zhu Li made their escape on Juicy.[15]\n" +
            "Conquering Republic City\n" +
            "Baatar Jr. and Kuvira hug\n" +
            "Kuvira lovingly hugged Baatar Jr., looking forward to marrying him after claiming victory over the United Republic of Nations.\n" +
            "After the successful test of her spirit energy cannon, Kuvira had the weapon be attached to the right arm of an enormous mecha suit in order to facilitate easy transportation. She returned to Zaofu, where she addressed her troops, thanking them for all their hard work for the past three years. However, she noted that their quest to truly reunite the Earth Empire was not yet complete, as they still needed to reclaim the United Republic of Nations, believing the land to have been stolen from the Earth Empire by Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko following the Hundred Year War. As she finished her speech, she retreated with Baatar Jr. out of sight, where she thanked him for all his support, noting that she could have never achieved her goals without his help and looked forward to marrying him after they claimed victory over Republic City.\n" +
            "Enormous mecha suit cockpit\n" +
            "Kuvira aimed her spirit energy cannon at Team Avatar.\n" +
            "Although she initially intended to attack Republic City two weeks later, Kuvira launched her invasion a week before schedule, realizing that Zhu Li, who knew about their plans, had warned the United Republic. She piloted the enormous mecha suit carrying the spirit energy cannon herself and used it to destroy a military outpost of the United Republic, preventing the troops there to give away their position. Only a few hours away from Republic City, Kuvira was alerted by one of her technicians about the presence of a flying bison and, deducing it was Team Avatar, immediately took aim at them. After missing twice, she was content with letting the team flee back to Republic City, confident that even without the element of surprise, no one could stop them.\n" +
            "Arriving at Republic City, Kuvira brushed off President Raiko's demand that she retreated with her army, noting that he was in no position to order her. To emphasize her words, she used the power of her spirit energy cannon to sink the United Forces battleships in a matter of seconds. Subsequently aiming her weapon at the United Forces ground troops, she gave Raiko three seconds to surrender, lest she would wipe out his army. As he surrendered the city, Kuvira also ordered him to turn over his army and the Avatar to her, as well as notifying Baatar Jr. of his location, so Baatar Jr. could present him with the terms of the Earth Empire.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Kuvira steeling herself\n" +
            "Kuvira steeled herself for the consequences of her decision to blow up the Future Industries factory where Baatar Jr. was being held in order to take down Avatar Korra.\n" +
            "When Kuvira contacted her fiancÃ© to check in on his progress, she was told by Raiko that Baatar Jr. had failed to show up at Air Temple Island. She was shocked to receive a call from Baatar Jr. moments later, who revealed that he had been captured. She was glad to know that he was unharmed, though upon learning that Avatar Korra was with him, she ordered one of her technicians to trace the radio signal to its original location. Baatar Jr. pleaded with her to cease her conquest of the United Republic of Nations, because if she would continue, Korra would refuse to let him go, keeping them apart forever. As her technician identified Baatar Jr. and Korra's position, Kuvira agreed with her fiancÃ© that Republic City was not worth sacrificing their life together and told Baatar Jr. she loved him. Steeling herself for her next action, she took aim at the Future Industries factory where he and Korra were located and blew it up with the spirit energy cannon.[8]\n" +
            "Obscuring Kuvira&#039;s view\n" +
            "Kuvira found her vision obscured by paint balloons thrown at her enormous mecha suit by airbenders.\n" +
            "Kuvira subsequently marched her army inside the city, ordering her troops to round up all the citizens they could find. When several airbenders approached her enormous suit, she fired the spirit energy cannon at them and tried to swat them away, though could not prevent them from eventually reaching her machine and drop paint balloons on its windows, obscuring her vision. As such, she was caught off guard when Bolin used his lavabending to slightly sink the left foot of her mecha suit, Wei and Wing tied its legs with metal cables, and Korra and the other airbenders blasted her machine with air currents in an attempt to knock it off balance. After cleaning the glass, she retaliated by firing wildly at Korra, who ducked underneath the beam, causing it to destroy several of the city's buildings. Although the suit was pushed back, Kuvira managed to regain control and balance it, enabling herself to fire a clean shot at the airbenders. Although she failed to kill anyone, she forced the defenders to retreat and was able to continue her conquest of the city. Noticing that two of her mecha platoons had suddenly shut down, Kuvira asked what had caused the malfunction and was told that they had been hit by an electromagnetic pulse, though was assured that the power core of the enormous suit was left unaffected. She ordered one of her technicians to locate the origin of the pulse, deducing it would lead them to Varrick's location, and signaled her third and fourth mecha platoons to move in and continue the sweep of the city, capturing everyone they found.\n" +
            "Kuvira surprised\n" +
            "Kuvira was surprised to encounter much resistance from the airbenders.\n" +
            "When she was later informed that the source of the electromagnetic pulse was Future Industries Tower, Kuvira marched her enormous mecha suit toward the building, though found her path blocked by Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing. She instantly fired at the Avatar, though upon missing, she was barraged with several large chunks of earth. When she fired again, she was taken by surprise by an aerial attack from Tenzin, Jinora, Ikki, Meelo, Bumi, Daw, Kai, and another female airbender, who pushed the weaponized arm of her suit down with a tornado, causing her to fire at the ground and stagger backward due to the backlash. Regaining her balance within the suit, Kuvira was taken aback when she saw Meelo breathing on the windows of the suit, though swiftly recovered and tried to squash him. As he flew away, she fired the spirit energy cannon at him and although he evaded its beam, she nearly took down Tenzin and Jinora instead. Continuing her advance toward Future Industries Tower, she gasped in shock when Bolin, Lin, and Suyin collapsed the top stories of a building atop her suit. Although she tried to push it back, she was unable to stop it and was buried underneath the rubble. Kuvira was able to erect her machine again, however, much to the defenders' shock. When Wei and Wing tried to bury her again with another building, she thwarted their attack by severing their metal cables with an energy beam, causing them to plummet down.\n" +
            "Distressed Kuvira\n" +
            "Kuvira grew distressed over the possibility of Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, and Suyin entering her enormous mecha suit.\n" +
            "Before she could reach Future Industries Tower, Kuvira noticed that two hummingbird mecha suits were incoming and instantly shot at them. Having missed, she noticed that one of the suits had landed on the back of her machine and promptly moved to crush it, only narrowly missing her target. When the other suit landed on her machine's right thigh, she attacked again, though once again failed to crush it. Despite her inability to shake the small hummingbird suits, Kuvira prevented them from landing and causing damage by continuously lashing out at them. She was thwarted in her endeavor, however, when Korra used water from a nearby canal to encase her mecha suit in ice. With only her right arm still at her disposal, Kuvira managed to shoot the wing off Varrick and Zhu Li's suit, though soon found the limb also encased in ice. Noticing Asami and Hiroshi's mecha suit having landed on her machine's thigh and started welding, she called out to her technicians that they needed to increase the power of the suit, so she was able to free herself. Kuvira eventually managed to break through the ice and crushed the small suit, killing Hiroshi in the process, though she was too late to prevent him from welding a hole in her platinum armor. When Korra, Bolin, Mako, Suyin, and Lin made a dash for the opening, she tried to crush them as well, though found her attack thwarted by Korra's waterbending once again and was thus unable to stop them from entering her machine.[16]\n" +
            "Korra fighting Kuvira\n" +
            "Kuvira and Korra fought in the cockpit of the enormous mecha suit when its power core detonated.\n" +
            "With now an arm free, Kuvira quickly destroyed the remaining ice on her mecha suit and ordered her technicians to initiate a lockdown and to find the Avatar and whoever else was with her. When she was alerted that the loading mechanism of the spirit energy cannon was malfunctioning, Kuvira corrected the technician that it was no malfunction but foul play, as she could feel someone metalbending inside the arm. She tried to bend the limb in order to shake the people there, though when she lost the connection, she opted to rip the arm off entirely instead, tossing it and the now useless cannon attached to it away. Kuvira was surprised when Korra forced open the hatch to the cockpit and immediately took down the two soldiers she had up there with her with a powerful gust of air. When the Avatar assaulted her with a fire blast, she managed to avoid it and retaliated with liquid metal, though Korra was able to deflect it and sent it back at her, knocking her down by solidifying the liquid at the last moment. After trading several blows, both women switching between offense and defense, their duel was interrupted when the enormous suit exploded from within, throwing the top half in which they were fighting against a building, where it fell down several stories.\n" +
            "Korra saving Kuvira\n" +
            "Kuvira was saved by Korra, who risked her own life to bend the beam from the spirit energy cannon away from her.\n" +
            "Supported by Korra, Kuvira was helped out of the suit's cockpit and laid down on the ground. When Korra sternly told her that it was over and that she needed to call off her army and surrender to President Raiko, Kuvira launched a rock at the Avatar, knocking her down. By the time Korra had risen to her feet again, Kuvira had vanished inside the Spirit Wilds. Staggering around, she heard Korra call to her that she should give up, though only muttered an answer to herself, stating that she would never do such a thing. She eventually found the spirit energy cannon that had been thrown inside the forest suspended in the air with vines and called to Korra that if the young woman really wanted to end it, she needed to come find her. When Korra burst through the vegetation and ended up in front of the weapon's barrel, Kuvira fired at her, ignoring the Avatar's warning not to do so. She was surprised to find the weapon interacting with the energy of the surrounding vines and it soon spun out of control, forcing Kuvira to hang on for life. She failed to manually shut the weapon down and was thrown free. Kuvira helplessly looked on when the energy beam threatened to kill her, though was surprised to find Korra jumping in front of her and holding the beam at bay, though the enormous surge of energy expanded around them and exploded.\n" +
            "Korra sympathizes with Kuvira\n" +
            "Kuvira denounced Korra's statement that they were similar and that she understood where she came from.\n" +
            "When Kuvira regained consciousness, she found herself in Korra's arms and pushed her down in her haste to get away. Noticing their surroundings, she asked Korra what happened and if they were dead, to which she was told that the energy from the cannon had torn open a new passage to the Spirit World and had blasted them in there. Confused, she demanded to know why Korra would risk her life to safe her after everything she had put her through, though when the Avatar explained that she saw a lot of herself in her, she denounced the likeness. Kuvira mused that nothing went as she had desired it to, noting that none of it would have happened if Korra and her allies had all just surrendered. When Korra countered that she had brought it all on herself by tampering with the spirit vines and acting like a dictator, Kuvira snapped at her, stating that she had been merely trying to help her people, since Suyin had turned her back on them and the Avatar had been absent. She bit at Korra that she could not possibly understand her, since the Avatar was adored by millions whereas she had been abandoned by her own parents as if she had meant nothing to them and declared that she had to prevent the same thing from happening to her nation when it needed someone to guide it. Kuvira softened, however, when Korra sympathized with her desired to create a place where she and her people would never be vulnerable again, disclosing that she understood how it felt to live in fear as she would have done anything to feel in control again after having been poisoned by Zaheer.\n" +
            "Handcuffed Kuvira\n" +
            "After Korra saved her life, Kuvira surrendered, realizing that the Avatar possessed a power she could never achieve.\n" +
            "Kuvira was supported out of the Spirit World by Korra, where they were immediately faced by Team Avatar and a platoon of mecha suits. When the Earth Empire sergeant demanded her release, Kuvira ordered her soldiers to stand down and surrendered, acknowledging that the Avatar had saved her life and possessed a power beyond what she could ever hope to achieve. Resigning herself to whatever punishment the world deemed appropriate for her, she let herself be handcuffed by Lin. Kuvira apologized to Suyin for all the anguish she had caused her and her family, before willingly letting herself be escorted away by the Beifong sisters.[1]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +

            "Traumatized by being abandoned by her own parents as a child,[1] Kuvira is driven by a fierce desire to protect and guide the citizens of the Earth Kingdom and persistent on achieving national unity through the use of military force. Her willingness to usher in an age of solidarity and collective well-being was further nurtured by Suyin Beifong's progressive ideology, to which she was exposed to from early childhood.[9]\n" +
            "Kuvira smirks\n" +
            "Kuvira was not hesitant about leaving a group of bandits to die if they refused to pledge their loyalty to her.\n" +
            "During her time in Zaofu, Kuvira was generally a caring person with a warm disposition, loyal and obedient to authority, following orders from her former superiors with no protest.[10] However, during her campaign to restore order, her demeanor changed to one of self-righteousness and she demonstrates a capacity to be aggressive to those who defy her or criticize her motives, having threatened to leave a group of bandits to die on a train rail were they to decline her offer to serve her, as well as having threatened Varrick's life when he refused to continue his spirit vine experiments. In addition, she did not hesitate to leave the capital of Yi without providing aid to its impoverished citizens when she was disrespected by the state's governor, whom she berated for failing to put his citizens' needs ahead of his own pride. Kuvira is persuasive and capable of convincing state leaders into pledging their allegiance to her, but is also proficient in the use of intimidation if individuals refuse to comply with her requests.[2]\n" +
            "Ultimately, Kuvira came to believe that giving control of the Earth Kingdom to someone based on lineage was archaic, believing that she was more suited to govern the nation. Her relentlessness in reuniting the Earth Kingdom has become a goal that justifies all the means that she deems necessary to achieve it, which included forcing citizens into slave labor, removing dissenters and people not from Earth Kingdom descent to reeducation camps, and experimenting with weapons of mass destruction, like the spirit vine technology.[6] Her confidence in her own right and skill stretched to the point where she challenged Korra to a duel in order to prevent an all out battle and possibly risk the lives of her soldiers, displaying both her personal bravery and a certain loyalty toward her army.[14] Though she usually possessed a calm and serious composure, she was shown to be short-tempered and became agitated and hostile when provoked or threatened, such as when she was heavily criticized by the governor of Yi,[2] or when her giant mecha suit was being breached by the Satos.[16]\n" +

            "In a rare moment of vulnerability, Kuvira opened up to Korra and helped the Avatar to understand her.\n" +
            "Despite all that, Kuvira has also shown a softer side to her personality during her private time, urging Opal to reconcile with her family and gently easing Bolin's fears as to her intentions. She is welcoming to her allies and fans.[7] She has also shown the capacity to forgive those who are loyal to her.[6] However, Kuvira is willing to sacrifice anyone to achieve her goals, as demonstrated when she decided to blow up the factory where her fiancÃ© was kept to have a chance at taking out Avatar Korra.[8]\n" +
            "Abilities\n" +

            "Kuvira displays mastery in the use of metalbending, capable of traversing several terrains and climbing large mountainsides with relative ease using metal cables. She also demonstrates considerable physical strength, having been able to grip Tonraq with a cable and support his weight.[11] Coupled with incredible accuracy and agility, Kuvira can subdue several dozen opponents simultaneously by covering their eyes and binding their limbs with metal strips, allowing her to toss opponents around with little difficulty.[2] She can also easily fashion an assortment of weapons from a little metal, such as knives,[14] a blade, and whips.[15] Kuvira has demonstrated the ability to sense when others are performing metalbending in her vicinity.[16]\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Kuvira is a smart and natural leader, as evident by her service as captain of the guard in Zaofu and further by her accomplishments as the \"Great Uniter\". She is also shown to be a charismatic and effective public speaker, instilling great respect in her followers. She is capable of engaging in persuasive negotiation, but can also employ intimidation in order to convince state leaders into pledging their allegiance to her and her cause. Using these abilities, Kuvira has managed to bring all Earth Kingdom states into her control, earning her a fierce reputation in the Earth Kingdom.[2]\n" +
            "As a former member of Suyin's dance troupe, she is able to maintain balance and posture while swinging down a metal cable. Kuvira is also agile, a skill that allows her to evade attacks in battle with no wasted movement.[14] In addition, this acrobatic background allows her to utilize a dynamic fighting style involving rapid shifts between offense and defense\n";

    public static String katDesc = "Katara is a waterbending master, born in the Southern Water Tribe to Chief Hakoda and his wife, Kya. During her childhood, she was the only waterbender living in the South Pole. At first she lived a peaceful life with her family, until she lost her mother in a Fire Nation raid. After her father left to battle against the Fire Nation in the Hundred Year War, Katara was raised by her grandmother, Kanna, alongside her older brother Sokka. As a teenager, she and her brother discovered the young Air Nomad Avatar, Aang, who had been frozen in an iceberg with his bison, Appa, for one hundred years.[8] In need of a waterbending master, the siblings and Aang left the South Pole on a journey toward the Northern Water Tribe.[9] Katara and Sokka eventually became close friends with Aang, and after their journey to the North Pole, continued to travel with him across the world as he mastered the remaining elements, earth and fire. The siblings' assistance helped Aang halt the Fire Nation's ambitions of world domination, ending the century-long war, and finally restoring balance to the world.[10]\n" +
            "The murder of Katara's mother, Kya[11] and the later departure of her warrior father, Hakoda,[8] left her feeling traumatized and alone.[12] Though she was cared for by her grandmother, Kanna,[8][9] she invariably found herself filling the mother role left behind by Kya, even to her own older brother. As was the custom of the Water Tribe for women to see to domestic duties, Katara soon took on many of the responsibilities expected of an adult and quickly became independent and strong willed. Morally and emotionally driven, she developed a great sense of justice and compassion for others, becoming fiercely protective of those in need.\n" +
            "Initially, Katara's waterbending abilities were limited because there was no one to teach her at the South Pole.[8][9] However, after acquiring a waterbending scroll,[13] and formal training at the North Pole,[14] her determination and hard work allowed her to surpass Aang and completely master the element. She became Aang's waterbending instructor after their departure from the Northern Water Tribe, replacing Master Pakku,[15] who had instructed them during their time there. Her mastery of water made her a formidable asset to the group. After the Hundred Year War ended, Katara and Aang began a close romantic relationship[10] that eventually led to marriage, and raising a family with three children: Bumi, a nonbender who gained the ability to airbend later in life, Kya, a waterbender, and Tenzin, an airbender.\n" +

            "Born into the diminished Southern Water Tribe to Hakoda and Kya, Katara faced the reality of her tribe's dwindling strength from an early age. At the time of her birth, forty-five years of repeated Fire Nation invasions intended to capture and imprison the tribe's waterbenders had left them devoid of benders. The tribe's defenses would have crumbled under the might of the Fire Nation; however, because of their relative inaccessibility in the South Pole, and the perception that they were a non-threat, they were mostly left alone. However, when Katara was eight, the Fire Nation again raided the village when charged by Fire Lord Azulon to find and dispose of the last remaining waterbender in the tribe. During the battle, the leader of the raid Yon Rha confronted Katara's mother, who was taking refuge in the family's igloo. Seeking shelter with her mother, Katara ran back to her home and interrupted their exchange. Realizing the intentions of Yon Rha, who had demanded Kya tell him the identity of the waterbender, Kya insisted Katara leave, and gave herself up as the last waterbender, lying to protect her daughter. Katara ran to fetch her father, Hakoda, but by the time they returned, Yon Rha had left and her mother had been killed.[11] The death of their mother had a profound impact on both Katara and Sokka.\n" +

Katara began to take on many of the domestic responsibilities expected of women of the Southern Water Tribe, despite her young age. Several years later, her father Chief Hakoda, left to fight in the Hundred Year War with the rest of the men of the Southern Water Tribe.[8] Katara and Sokka were left in the care of their grandmother, Kanna. Though Kanna loved the two and cared deeply for them, Katara was left feeling traumatized and alone.\n" +
            "Living in a tribe consisting almost entirely of women, children, and elderly, Katara took care of not only her own family, but aided others as well.[9] She developed a protective and motherly personality which she would carry with her for the remainder of her life. Even to her own elder brother, Sokka, she was sometimes seen as a maternal figure. Much later, Katara overheard her brother admitting to being unable to picture his mother, whose image had been replaced by Katara's.[19] Katara displayed deep affection for those she traveled with, as well as being fiercely protective whenever danger threatened their safety. The inner strength she had developed in the absence of parental figures aided her in keeping Aang and their friends together through their most difficult experiences.\n" +

            "Harmony Restoration Movement\n" +
            "As part of the Harmony Restoration Movement, Katara and her friends began moving Fire Nation colonials back to the Fire Nation, starting with the more recent colonial establishments. A year later, when Aang, Katara, and Sokka were assisting in the relocation of a Fire Nation colony led by Mayor Nishi, the team found out that Zuko had withdrawn his support for the movement, so they immediately traveled to Yu Dao, the colony where the Fire Lord was staying. After landing, soldiers ordered Aang to leave.\n" +
            "Zuko stopping Katara\n" +
            "Katara was subdued by Zuko after she attacked a group of Fire Nation guards.\n" +
            "Once there, Katara and the rest of Team Avatar encountered a protest that included several members of the Freedom Fighters and learned that Zuko was preventing people from entering and exiting Yu Dao, so she and Aang flew over the colony's walls with his glider to meet the Fire Lord. They were, however, confronted by Fire Nation soldiers who prevented them from talking to Zuko, so they had to fight them. After Aang defeated several guards, Katara became enraged when she saw the guards were trying to set her boyfriend on fire and knocked them out. Zuko suddenly grabbed Katara, admonishing her for attacking his \"people\". Aang, angry at Zuko's action, warned him to let her go, but after he insisted that she had first to agree to stop attacking his people, Aang separated Zuko from Katara with airbending, prompting him to retaliate, causing the airbender to block the attack and enter the Avatar State. But Katara, telling him that he would not be able to control himself in an altered emotional state, managed to calm him down. The Fire Lord agreed to talk and gave the couple a tour of Yu Dao, pointing out how heavily integrated the lives of the citizens were in the colony. At this, Katara proposed a meeting with the Earth King concerning the matter, to which the Avatar and the Fire Lord both agreed.\n" +
            "After leaving Yu Dao, Smellerbee said that Aang had three days to make a compromise before the Freedom Fighters take action. On Appa, Aang thanked Katara for not letting him kill Zuko while in the Avatar State. The group continued to Ba Sing Se in order to inform Earth King Kuei about the colony's situation as Toph explained to Katara what Sokka meant with 'oogies'.[20]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As Katara arrived in Ba Sing Se with Aang, they met two girls, who claimed to be members of the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club, much to the airbender's excitement but Katara's indifference. After learning they were looking for a place to stay, the girls immediately offered their clubhouse. They spent the night and the following morning there as Aang entertained the girls, much to Katara's annoyance and apparent jealousy as she was left out of the party. She reminded Aang that they had to meet with the Earth King, finally getting him to leave the clubhouse. After leaving, Aang thanked Katara for allowing him to spend some time with the girls, as he had felt like he was at home again, but she, feeling guilty because of her attitude, responded that she did not deserve it.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang and Katara talking to Kuei\n" +
            "Katara and Aang attempted to convince Kuei to arrange a meeting with Zuko.\n" +
            "When Aang and Katara went to the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace and met Kuei, they communicated him the news. At the king's final decision of sending troops to attack Yu Dao to solve the conflict, the couple showed their surprise and disagreement, however, they were not able to change the sovereign's mind. Realizing that sending in the army would be seen as a declaration of war, Aang and Katara hurried back toward Yu Dao in an attempt to persuade as many of the Fire Nation colonials there to evacuate.[21]\n" +
            "Upon their return at Yu Dao, Aang attempted to evacuate the city, though they were met with severe resistance from both earth and firebenders. After fighting off their attackers, the couple noticed Smellerbee, Kori, and the Yu Dao branch of the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club, much to Katara's annoyance. However, she came to the fan club's defense when Aang got angry at them for sporting Air Nomad attire, opting that it was probably a mistake. When an angry Aang stormed off, she followed him onto the roof, and comforted him when he verbalized his conflicting opinions about his promise to Zuko, and the separation of the four nations. Offering him her opinion, she reminded him of the words Guru Pathik and Huu told him prior: separation is an illusion, so is the separation of the four nations, who are actually all the same.\n" +

            "Aang and Katara&#039;s future\n" +
            "Katara had a vision of her and Aang together in the future.\n" +
            "Later, when Aang entered the Avatar State to fulfill his promise, Katara calmed him down, and explained that when she saw Kori's family, she saw their future, outing her doubts about what would happen to them as a couple if the four nations would remain separate. Sharing a kiss, she convinced him to find a quiet place to think about it all before jumping to action based on rushed conclusions.\n" +
            "When the battle unfolded, Katara used her waterbending to confront King Kuei and eventually took him into the city to show him the lives he would change were he to persist in his war.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "A smiling Katara later witnessed Aang declaring that he would teach the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club the ways of his people, calling them the first Air Acolytes.[22]\n" +

            "Katara scolded Sokka by waterbending a snowball at him.\n" +
            "Sometime after the battle for Yu Dao, Katara attended a meeting together with her friends and several government officials at the home of the governor of Yu Dao to discuss the future of the city. She was listening attentively to the lecture that an Earth Kingdom professor gave on ancient Earth Kingdom philosophies regarding the four nations, though got annoyed and subsequently shushed her brother and boyfriend as the two kept talking among themselves. Aang swiftly apologized, but when Sokka commented that he was not surprised that she, his \"boring sister\", was interested in the \"boring\" lecture of the professor, she promptly waterbent the water from her glass into his face, transforming it into a snowball midair. She repeated the action a few moments later after a similar insult by her brother.\n" +
            "A week later, Katara traveled to the Fire Nation Royal Palace together with Aang and Sokka upon Zuko's inquiry. Upon arrival, they were delightfully surprised when they discovered Iroh there as well. Zuko explained that Iroh was there to act as interim Fire Lord while he would be gone, looking for Ursa, a journey on which he invited Team Avatar to accompany him. The amicable atmosphere quickly changed, however, when Azula emerged from behind Zuko, and Katara promptly attacked the princess with ice spikes, which she easily avoided. Zuko explained the situation and after some words, Team Avatar accepted that Azula would come with them in search for Ursa.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara warning Azula to never harm Sokka\n" +
            "Katara warned Azula to never touch Sokka again.\n" +
            "The following day, as Aang was preparing Appa for the journey toward Hira'a, taking care of Azula's luggage, Katara voiced her still present concerns about the princess's presence on the trip, though she took confidence in the knowledge that if Azula did try something, there would be four of them to take her down. When Azula subsequently zapped Sokka with her lightning, Katara was quick to trap the princess's hand in ice with her waterbending to prevent any further action. As the tension subsided, she released her, withdrawing the water into her pouch, though warned Azula to never touch her brother again, albeit to little effect.\n" +
            "As they set off on their journey, Katara rode atop Appa's head, sitting next to Aang. When Sokka commented how the adventure felt like \"old times\", Katara and Aang kissed, after Aang had stated that it was better than old times, since he could now kiss her whenever. The mood was broken, however, when Azula had another one of her aggressive psychotic episode, followed by Aang's making a gruesome expression, caused by the presence of the wolf spirit, though no one could see the creature. Sokka mocked the Avatar, much to the annoyance of Katara, who asked him to stop as Aang's situation was serious, though when he would not let up, she ended his mockery with another snowball to the face. Their playful antics suddenly became serious when Azula had dived off Appa and set fire to Aang's glider, who had swooped down to save her from plummeting to her death, subsequently sending him crashing down on the ground. As they landed, Katara and Sokka quickly jumped off to tend to the downed airbender, while Zuko went after his sister.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara trapping Azula\n" +
            "Katara encased Azula in ice to prevent a duel between the princess and Zuko from ensuing.\n" +
            "Katara, Sokka, and Aang caught up with the two firebenders at a nearby river, right when they were about to fight one another. Katara cut the battle short by encasing Azula in ice, completely immobilizing her. As Zuko talked to the other guys, Katara crossed the river to yell at Azula that she did not appreciate her actions against Aang. Azula's insulting rebuttal was cut short, however, as the wolf spirit Aang had seen earlier showed up and attacked them. Katara and Zuko noticed that the pattern on the spirit's chest was the same as the gruesome face Aang was making, prompting the young Avatar to attempt to reason with the creature. When his attempts failed as the wolf snapped at him, Katara, together with Zuko and Sokka, launched another attack at it, though her ice spears shattered without effect against the spirit's side. After a brief scuffle with Appa, the spirit threw up a swarm of moth wasps that attacked the entire group, making it hard for Katara to breathe. They were eventually saved when Azula shot a lightning bolt away from them all, drawing the moths and the wolf spirit with it.\n" +
            "That night, Katara agreed with Aang and Zuko to each take turns watching Azula sleep. Awaiting her turn, she tried to get some sleep next to Appa.[23]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang and Katara extinguish the fire\n" +
            "After a psychotic Azula caused a wildfire, Aang and Katara needed much time to smother it.\n" +
            "The next morning, Katara was startled when Azula woke up and suddenly grabbed her wrist. Sokka forced the princess to let his sister go with his boomerang. Azula realized that the letter she was carrying was missing and consequently grew angry, demanding to know Zuko's whereabouts. She set the camp on fire as a distraction, forcing the Water Tribe siblings to deal with it, as she went out in search of Aang and Zuko. Aang returned to help extinguish the fire and by the time they were able to smother it, Zuko had managed to calm his sister down. They continued on to Hira'a.\n" +
            "Arriving at the outskirts of the village, the group went in disguise, so the Fire Lord and Avatar could avoid attracting attention, and came upon the entire town attending the Hira'a Acting Troupe's version of the play, Love amongst the Dragons. After the play concluded, Zuko started asking about Ursa. This caught the attention of Noren, the director of the acting company, who invited them all to his home, where they could talk more freely. Aang and Katara complimented Noriko, Noren's wife, about their lovely home, and the Avatar asked how long they had been married. Noriko happily informed them that it had been nearly five years, subsequently embarrassing the young couple when she noted that they were perhaps a bit young to be already thinking about marriage, though she soon digressed, concluding that love was ageless. Under the cover of being drama historians, they did not find any new information regarding Ursa, but they did learn that her ex-boyfriend, Ikem left town, heading toward Forgetful Valley.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As they left the family's home, Azula voiced her disgust and stated that if it wasn't for Zuko, she'd burn their house down, convinced that their happiness was all an act. Katara became upset and tempers flared between her and Azula, before Zuko announced that they will be going to Forgetful Valley.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara plantbending\n" +
            "Katara used her waterbending abilities to defend against Misu's attacks.\n" +
            "Upon arriving, Azula's first thought was to firebend a path, which Zuko and Aang quickly put out. Suddenly, Aang started to make a weird facial expression similar to their encounter with the wolf spirit. Sokka noted that there were facial markings on all the plants and animals surrounding them. Aang spotted a flutter bat, who had exactly the same pattern on his wings as he had on his face, and followed it down to a round pond. Aang felt a spiritual calmness surrounding the water, sensing a resemblance to the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole, and asked everyone to be respectful. However, Azula disregarded his request and fired a lightning bolt straight into the pool, believing that her mother was there. Soon after, the group was attacked by plants and vines, though the skirmish was cut short as Katara deduced the attackers to be waterbenders, and forced them to reveal themselves.\n" +
            "Heeding the order, Rafa and Misu showed themselves, and set up camp with the others, sharing a meal. Misu warned them that Forgetful Valley's ponds needed to remained undisturbed, and retold the team her life's story. When Aang learned that they were on the lookout for a spirit with the ability to grant faces, one that only appear when the wolf spirit appears at one of the ponds, he offered his help. But as Aang meditated, Azula suffered another of her psychotic episodes, believing that her mother sent the elderly Water Tribe siblings to impede her progress and aimed a bolt of lightning at them, which Zuko attempted to stop.[24]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "With Azula showing no signs of restraint, Katara and Sokka prepared to attack the princess at Zuko's insistence. Katara waterbent at Azula despite Misu's protests to not disturb the area. Aang was able to get them to stop after revealing he had summoned the Mother of Faces, who would grant them only one request. Zuko decided to let Misu have Rafa's face restored, but Azula interrupted and instead asked for and received information on Ursa. The Mother of Faces told the group that she had been visited by Ursa, and gave her a new face. Azula fled toward Hira'a, Sokka and Zuko following them. Katara and Aang remained with Rafa and Misu, with the Avatar trying to pursue the Mother of Faces under her sacred pool's water. After Aang was ejected from the pool, Katara came to his aid while the spirit appeared before them, denouncing humans for being selfish and making her their slave. She ordered them to leave, with her spirits attacking the group to force them out.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara and Aang tried to ward the spirits off, with the waterbender able to protect Misu from a spirit by freezing its claws. After Aang incidentally revealed Rafa's empty face, he recognized it at the work of Koh, which, upon hearing this name, prompted the Mother of Faces to tell her animals to stop their attack. Aang explained what he had learned about Koh, to which the Mother of Faces told the group he was her son. Katara and Aang watched as the ancient spirit restored Rafa's face, and they happily watched as the siblings hugged. Afterward, they returned to Hira'a with the spirit, who restored Ursa's face and memories. With Azula having escaped and left the letter behind, Katara watched as Aang and Sokka discussed if they thought the princess had truly begun to change. Sokka argued against this, but Aang believed she had, to which Katara kissed her boyfriend on the cheek, saying that she loved him because he saw the bright side of things.[25]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Returning Ursa to the Fire Nation Capital\n" +
            "As Zuko desired to have Ursa, Ikem, and Kiyi visit the Fire Nation Capital for the first time since Ursa's banishment, Katara, Aang, and Sokka accompanied the family on the Fire Nation cruiser that was bringing them all back. She and her brother watched how Aang was entertaining Kiyi by riding a flying dolphin fish together. When Katara suggested he join them, Sokka refused by claiming a preference for mechanical rides, with the exception of Appa.\n" +
            "Some time later, Katara, Aang, and Sokka prepared to leave on Appa. As Zuko inquired about their intention, Katara noted that being back to the city will bring up many memories and that they could use that opportunity as bonding time.[26]\n" +

            "Katara reminding Aang\n" +
            "Katara reminded Aang of the importance of celebrations in every day life.\n" +
            "When the peace talks in Yu Dao came to an end, Katara and the rest of Team Avatar returned there to witness the introduction of the city's new coalition government. Afterward, she attended a banquet in celebration of the election with her friends. After a while, she began to worry where Aang had gone to and set out to search for him, finding him on a balcony, meditating. When she asked him what he was doing there, she was told that he had seen Yangchen's spirit, though since he had been unable to communicate with her, he was attempting to contact her through meditation. Although she acknowledged that meditation was important to Aang, she reminded him that celebrations like the one they were supposed to be attending were something important too. Reminded of Yangchen's Festival by her words, Aang returned inside with Katara, where he alerted the three Air Acolytes, Xing Ying, Yee-Li, and Jingbo, as well as Katara and the other members of Team Avatar that they would go on a field trip the following day.\n" +
            "Toph refusing to bow\n" +
            "Katara happily partook in a bowing ceremony as part of Yangchen's Festival, knowing how much it meant to Aang.\n" +
            "As such, the team left the next day on Appa, setting course to a cliff overlooking the ocean where the Air Nomads used to start their celebration of Yangchen's Festival. Katara tried to get her brother and Toph in the spirits of the holiday, noticing how excited Aang and the Air Acolytes were about it all. Having arrived, they were supposed to take part in a bowing ceremony. When Toph refused to take part, Katara tried to reason with the earthbender, pointing out how important it was to Aang, though Aang asked her to let it go, which she did. After the bowing ceremony, the group set out toward the meadow to enjoy a ceremonial meal. Along the way, tensions rose again when Toph destroyed Yee-Li's cymbals, with which she was creating Air Nomad music as was tradition. Katara once again tried to calm the earthbender, though was cut short when Aang suggested tensely to just keep on walking toward the meadow.\n" +
            "They found out, however, that a town with a large refinery had been built on the previously sacred grounds. Walking around through town, Katara tried to console Aang, pointing out that a lot can change in a hundred years. Her attention was drawn away, however, when Niyok, a girl from the Southern Water Tribe whom she had not seen since leaving there, called out to her and happily greeted her. Upon asking what she was doing there, Katara was directed toward the Earthen Fire Refinery where the girl was working with her sister. Realizing that Nutha was there as well, Katara merrily called out to her fellow tribeswoman, though received a noncommittal stare back, prompting her to leave the sisters alone.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Polluted river\n" +
            "Katara and Aang discovered the river near the Earthen Fire Refinery to be severely polluted, assuming the factory to be to blame.\n" +
            "When Aang spotted Yangchen's spirit once more and let it lead him to investigate the grounds of the refinery, Katara and the three Air Acolytes followed him. She was helped across the fence by his earth- and airbending, where they discovered that the river running near the factory was terribly polluted. Before they could take any action, however, the refinery's guards appeared and tried to expel them from the factory's grounds. While Aang bent the Air Acolytes to safety, Katara used her waterbending to destroy the incoming earthen projectile. Bending a huge wave from the river, she urged Aang to move out of the way, intending to strike down the guards. However, Aang asked her to call off her attack, and subsequently used his airbending to let the guards knock each other out.\n" +
            "Their actions had been witnessed by Satoru, the refinery's engineer and interim boss while his uncle, Loban, was away on business, who heartily greeted him, instantly recognizing who they were. When Toph and Sokka returned, Satoru became starstruck by the young earthbender and promptly invited he, and on Toph's inquiry, Katara and the others, to join him on a tour through the factory, where benders and nonbenders from all over the world were employed. When Aang eventually managed to strike up a conversation with Satoru about the refinery's location and accused to factory of having defiled the sacred land, Katara backed him up, referring to the polluted river. When Toph corroborated Satoru's claim that the factory was not to blame for that and subsequently got into an argument with Aang, Katara urged the two earthbenders to remain calm after an earthquake shook the ground, assuming they were responsible for it. When a second quake occurred, Satoru asked them all to leave, but before they could heed the engineer's request, they heard a factory worker call out for help, as the earthquakes had left him trapped under a haywire machine. Katara used her waterbending to pulverize incoming rocks while Sokka ushered the workers to safety and Aang and Toph moved in to save the trapped man. After the crisis was averted, Katara was shocked to learn that Loban's business partner and co-owner of the refinery was Lao Beifong, Toph's father[27] and even more when Lao declared Toph to be a confused girl rather than his daughter.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka and Katara run\n" +
            "Katara was used by Sokka as a decoy to lure the Rough Rhinos to the river side, where she would have the upper hand.\n" +
            "When Lao subsequently ordered the Rough Rhinos to escort Team Avatar off the refinery's premises, Katara readied herself for battle and took on Yeh-Lu and a hammer-wielding Rough Rhino member by herself. Before she could finish the fight, however, she was dragged along by Sokka, who urged her to run along with him. When they were cornered at a fence, Katara readied her water once more, blaming her brother for making them easy targets. It was only after Sokka pushed her out of the way to let the Rhinos crush the fence and halt at the nearby river that Katara caught on to her brother's plan. Utilizing the water of the river, she quickly encased their three assailants in blocks of ice.\n" +
            "After Yeh-Lu's burning grenade exploded near the river, Katara noticed it had revealed an passageway which the siblings promptly checked out. Using glowing crystals, they illuminated their path and eventually arrived to an iron ore mine, which was also the cause of the river's pollution. They were found out by Kahchi and Vachir, who instigated a fight with them. After the skirmish between Vachir and Sokka led to the weakening of one of the mine's support beams, Katara used her waterbending to freeze Vachir's bow, arms, and feet. The interaction made Katara realize that the earthquakes were caused by the mine's instability and she and her brother tried to urge the present workers to leave. No one listened, however, though they were approached by Nutha and Niyok, who explained that everyone down there needed the job to survive, so no one dared to leave without their boss's orders.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph holding back the cave-in\n" +
            "Katara became trapped underground after the iron ore mine caved in.\n" +
            "Upon Sokka's return, accompanied by Lao Beifong, Katara directed his attention to the weakened support beams, which had been identified as being the cause of the earthquakes. Although the order was given to evacuate, Katara became trapped underground when the mine caved, along with Toph and several others. When Aang tried to bend a tunnel from above, she called out to him and urged him to stop, as if he bent it the wrong way, the entire tunnel might collapse.[28]\n" +
            "Hearing Aang call from above ground, Katara asked if Sokka was there. Aang replied that her brother had not returned and asked how Toph was holding up, she answered that she was doing as good as could be expected, given she was literally carrying the weight of their world. Seeing the earthbender growing exhausted, Katara asked Satoru to give her the remainder of her water, noting that running out would not matter if Toph failed. After Aang notified her of Toph's students' arrival, she told Toph, who asked her to tell Aang that the situation was like spider ants beneath stomping feet, only flipped. When the metalbending students removed the ground above them, Katara ran out to Aang, kissing him and saying she was glad to be out. Afterward, she happily reunited with Sokka before catching sight of Nutha and Niyok. Being thanked by the former, the waterbender stated with a smile that it was not a problem.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The skies, however, soon grew stormy, and though Katara initially believed that a storm was coming in, Aang told her it was not a natural event. After seeing him try to talk to Yangchen again and ponder a way to reach her, Katara asked if she could do anything to help, though was assured that her boyfriend could do it. After Aang returned and explained the situation at hand, including the need to destroy the buildings, the waterbender was urged to evacuate everyone from them. She began by destroying the cabbage merchant's restaurant, telling the panicked vendor that it was not safe for him to remain there, though adding that they could get him new cabbages after the situation ended. After completing the task, she returned to Aang and told him as such. After seeing Old Iron beginning to emerge from the sea, she asked if he would turn back if the town was returned to its natural state; after an affirmative answer, she warned Aang that he could not wait for the mask to be returned and comforted him over his regret about destroying things with a kiss on the cheek. The waterbender also added her assurance that she would keep the people from interfering in any way.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "With Old Iron nearing the town, Katara noticed Sokka, Satoru, and Loban clinging to the spirit's mask. She bent up a water vortex which allowed the three to slide down to the ground safely. She soon tried to block an attack from Old Iron, declaring he would not destroy the humans.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After Aang defeated Old Iron, Katara spent time reminiscing with Niyok and Nutha over life in the Southern Tribe. Noticing her boyfriend in an upset state, she decided to approach him, though not before telling Nutha it was good to catch up with them and apologizing for not returning home, though was told by her friend to stop, saying she acted like an idiot while telling her that Katara and Sokka made them proud as Southern Tribers. Approaching Aang, she noticed that Lady Tienhai's statue had been destroyed, much to her shock. Hearing him wonder if spirits had no place in the world as a relic of the past, the waterbender believed it could not be true. Taking his hands, she told Aang that they did have a place if he did as well. She urged him to contact his past lives, saying that the current time connected the past and present. Before walking away, Katara told him to find her if he needed her.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Three months later, Katara watched the proceedings of the new Spirits' Friendship Festival. She remarked it was not Air Nomad-like at all because of the kites, loud parade, and Sokka selling meat, something she did not have in mind when Aang told her about Yangchen's Festival.[29]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Later life\n" +
            "Aang, Katara, and their children\n" +
            "Katara and Aang had three children by the time they were in their early thirties, Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin.\n" +
            "Sometime after the Harmony Restoration Movement, Katara married Aang and gave birth to three children: Bumi, a nonbender who gained the ability to airbend later in life; Kya, a waterbender; and Tenzin, who was born an airbender like his father.[30] Katara continued to develop her skills in waterbending, eventually becoming a leading expert in its various styles and respective skills and techniques, as well as being regarded as the greatest master and healer in the world. She passed on these skills to her only daughter, Kya, who became a renowned healer in her own right.\n" +
            "In 124 AG, Katara wrote a letter to include in the book that Aang was assembling for Tenzin, in which she wished her son the joys of youth and the strength to accept his legacy as one of the world's last airbenders.[31] Before 128 AG, Katara's efforts led to the outlawing of bloodbending in the United Republic.[32]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Through Tenzin, who eventually married Pema, she became the paternal grandmother of Jinora, Ikki, Meelo, and Rohan. After the passing of Avatar Aang and his reincarnation into the new Avatar, Korra, she became the Avatar's waterbending teacher once again,[33] and included healing lessons in her teachings, making Korra a skilled healer.[17]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Elderly Katara\n" +
            "Katara lived in the Southern Water Tribe at the age of eighty-five, seventy years after the Hundred Year War.\n" +
            "In 170 AG, Katara supervised Korra's firebending test alongside other members of the Order of the White Lotus. She noted the Avatar's ferocity, to which the White Lotus leader responded that she also lacked restraint. After Korra defeated her opponents, the White Lotus turned to Katara for counsel, wondering whether or not they should let Korra start her airbending training with Tenzin since the young Avatar had yet to grasp the spiritual side of bending. Confident in her son's abilities, Katara announced that she believed Korra to be ready to commence her airbending training, as Tenzin would be able to teach her what she needed to know.[34]\n" +
            "When Tenzin and his family arrived at the Southern Water Tribe compound, Katara and Korra greeted Tenzin and his family. At her son's asking, Katara helped Meelo off of his head, much to her grandson's displeasure. As she expressed her joy over seeing her family again, Jinora approached her, informing her that she had read everything about her past adventures and asked what happened to Zuko's mother, Ursa. Katara attempted to elaborate, only to be interrupted by an excited Ikki, who fired several random questions at the old waterbender.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara, Pema, and Tenzin\n" +
            "Katara sensed her next grandchild would be a strong and healthy airbender.\n" +
            "As the young airbenders ran off to play in the snow, Katara turned her attention to Tenzin and Pema, the latter being pregnant with their fourth child. She predicted that the child would be an airbender, much to Pema's dismay, who explained that it would be nice to have a nonbending child like her. When asked if Tenzin and his siblings were as rambunctious as the young airbenders, Katara said that Tenzin had always been more serious than Kya and Bumi.\n" +
            "When it was revealed that Korra's airbending training with Tenzin was to be delayed and the Avatar decided to find her own path by traveling to Republic City on her own, Katara was the only one who understood that Korra had to go and find her own place in the world. Confident in Korra, she gave her husband's reincarnation her blessing.[34]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Months later, after Korra's bending had been removed by Amon, Katara tried using her healing powers to restore Korra's abilities, but to no avail. She later witnessed Korra, whose bending was restored by Aang, energybend Lin Beifong, restoring her earthbending abilities.[16]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara and her grandchildren\n" +
            "Katara was hugged by her grandchildren upon their arrival for the Glacier Spirits Festival.\n" +
            "Six months later, Katara invited her oldest son, Bumi, to attend the Glacier Spirits Festival with her and the rest of their family. However, when her children were reunited with one another, she could only look on with concern as Tenzin was being picked on by his elder siblings.\n" +
            "The next day, Katara encouraged Tenzin to take his siblings along with him on his trip to all the air temples, reasoning that he should cherish the time he spends with his entire family. She also felt that the three siblings should visit Aang's birthplace together. Tenzin agreed to let his siblings join him and gave his mother a farewell hug, promising to see her soon.[35] Before they all left, she gave Kya an old family picture of their family together while they were still young.[36]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara heals Jinora\n" +
            "Katara attempted to heal an unconscious Jinora, whose soul was trapped in the Spirit World.\n" +
            "During the Water Tribe Civil War, Katara did not interfere between the two combating parties, believing her fighting days to be over,[37] and instead helped tend to injured rebels along with several other healers in her healing hut. She was sought out by her family, who brought a spiritless Jinora for her to examine. Alarmed over the amount of time Jinora had been in that state, Katara placed her granddaughter in a bath of water to heal. Assessing the situation with her bending, she stated she was unsure how much longer Jinora would be able to survive with her body and spirit separated, noting that Jinora was strong to have lasted as long as she had.[38]\n" +
            "When Jinora's spirit later returned to her body, Katara happily embraced her granddaughter and later accompanied her and her family to Korra's announcement that peace was restored between the Southern and Northern Water Tribes and that the South was officially independent.[39]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Five weeks after the insurrection of the Red Lotus was put down, Katara was visited by a still injured Korra and set out to heal her. Katara commented that the mercury poisoning Korra had suffered had caused a lot of internal damage. Upon being asked if she could heal it, she remarked that all she could do was help guide the young Avatar's healing process, though the ultimate result of that was out of her hands. Reminiscing on the feeling of going through a traumatic experience, she told Korra that if she dedicated herself to getting better, she would recover stronger than ever.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara helping Korra\n" +
            "Katara worked intensively with Korra to help the Avatar recuperate from her mercury poisoning.\n" +
            "The two waterbenders set out on the hard process of recovery. Progress was slow, however, and after nearly six months, a frustrated Korra snapped at Katara over the elder's inability to heal her. Katara tried to console her, stating it was all right and urging her to let her anger and frustration flow like water. When Korra admitted that she was tired of the situation, Katara told her she was not the first Avatar who had to overcome great suffering. She recalled how Aang felt about the destruction of his entire culture and revealed that he had sought meaning in his suffering, which eventually led to peace. She urged Korra to do the same and guided her to take her first steps again in a long time. Katara continued to help Korra over the next two years until she was physically fit again.[18]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "When Katara was a young girl, her mother was killed in a Fire Nation raid.[11] This event had a tremendous impact on Katara's life and personality and arguably shaped her into the person she became. She was emotionally driven, involving herself completely in the heartache and needs of those around her. Placing her whole heart in the affairs of others, as well as bearing her own heartache, she was often easily reduced to tears. According to Sokka, Katara largely prevented their family from falling apart and took on many responsibilities to the point where she filled the void left by their mother (so much that he pictured her in place of his mother).[19] As such, Katara had a maternal personality and often acted as a motherly figure to the group, something that often irritated the rebellious Toph.[19] Her loss was also part of what drove her in her fight against the Fire Nation, although she did not exhibit as much outward prejudice as her brother. She was also a bit of a stickler for morality, even to the point of causing Sokka and Aang to faint from shock when she stated she wanted to pull a scam, as she had berated Toph for scamming people. According to Sokka, she was an optimist.[19]\n" +
            "She had a soft spot for children. When aiding in baby Hope's birth, she stated that she helped her grandmother deliver many babies in their tribe,[40] and in Jang Hui, she gave a portion of her food to a little boy.[1] She even went as far as to care for and defend Tom-Tom, Mai's little brother, despite the fact that he was from the Fire Nation and that everyone else, with the exception of Aang, was distrustful of him for it.[41]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara was caring and compassionate, and was often marked by a fierce determination to aid others. She stated herself that she would never turn away from people who need her help.[1] Katara was even willing to defend Fire Nation civilians such as when she helped the village of Jang Hui[1] and when she fought Hama,[42] who was from the Southern Water Tribe, to protect the Fire Nation village she was living in. This strong desire often frustrated others, particularly Sokka.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara as the Painted Lady\n" +
            "Even if she had to hide her identity, Katara never turned her back on people who needed her.\n" +
            "Katara was portrayed as the most mature member of the group, rarely taking part in Sokka and Aang's goofy pranks and Toph's less silly ones, though she did have a sense of humor. Katara was described as being motherly by Toph and Sokka.[19] While the team traveled through the Si Wong Desert, Katara was able to hold the group together in its most desperate moments.[43]\n" +
            "On the other hand, Katara could be overly domineering. For all her kindness and compassion, she was sometimes self-righteous, had a nasty temper, and could be fierce when provoked. With lack of sleep, this side of her can quickly become more apparent.[44] She was also set in her ideals and frequently refused to relent on her views in the face of opposition. Combined with her strong sense of compassion, this gave her a strong sense of justice and she would run headlong into often dangerous situations to help others, which was best illustrated at the prison rig[45] and at Jang Hui.[1] Her short temper had frequently clashed with others; she showed open, but short-lived, jealousy of Aang's talent,[13] and was frequently perturbed by Toph's confrontational and rebellious nature.[19][44]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Despite being one of the more compassionate members of the group, Katara was one of the least willing to let go of a grudge, especially against those who she felt had betrayed her trust. She held a considerable grudge against those who had threatened Aang, as Zuko[46] had, or done things she considered morally wrong, like Jet.[47][48] At the Western Air Temple she showed outright hostility toward Zuko and threatened to kill him if he slipped back to his old ways.[46] Upon her re-encounter with Jet, Katara reacted hostilely at the mere sight of him,[48] and she was harsh and unforgiving of Zuko even long after he had joined Team Avatar and gained the trust of everyone else.[11] However, this could be because Zuko's betrayal of her at Ba Sing Se[49] was far more personal than his betrayal of anyone else. For a while, she was also argumentative with her father because she felt that he had abandoned her and Sokka when he left to fight in the War.[12] However, Katara was sometimes willing to give people second chances; with much reluctance, she allowed Jet to guide Team Avatar to Appa, and she appeared to be saddened by his death.[48] Also, she offered to try and heal Zuko's scar when they were enemies.[49] Eventually, even after his betrayal, Katara decided to forgive him, embracing him as a friend, after he helped her find the man who killed her mother.[11]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara was marked by a fierce desire to learn waterbending, viewing it as a part of her and her culture that needed to be expressed.[8] She also may have viewed it as a hope for rebuilding her tribe. Her enthusiasm for waterbending caused her to constantly train herself in the art,[13] and when she finally found a master to teach her formally, she became overjoyed.[14] Having quickly advanced under the tutelage of Master Pakku, he stated that Katara accomplished this due to her fierce determination, passion and hard work.[50]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka told Toph that Katara could be a pain and would get \"involved and in-your-business\".[19] Even so, Katara was understanding of other people's privacy. This was best demonstrated when Katara continually scolded Sokka for snooping around Hama's inn and rummaging through her personal belongings.[42]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Motherly and feminine as she might be, Katara was not afraid to go beyond her feminine looks and way of being to achieve what she wanted. When she and Toph were denied entrance to a rowdy pub because the both of them were girls, they dressed up as boys. Katara in particular showed her masculine side when wanting to ride the pub's mechanized bull; she was even willing to start an all-out brawl with some of the guys there who mocked her ability to stay on the bull. The whole thing ended with Toph dragging Katara away before things came to a head. Katara and Toph later went to a spa and reflected on how being a girl was not so bad at all.[51]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Abilities\n" +
            "Waterbending\n" +
            "Katara's most notable ability was her waterbending. She rapidly developed her skill at the art, and her fierce resolve to master the element helped her become one of the most powerful waterbending masters.[50] She was identified as a waterbender when she was a small child. As she grew older, she kept practicing even though she did not have a teacher, and learned whatever little she could with great ambition, while ignoring the criticism of Sokka, as he downplayed her ability to bend, referring to it as \"magic water\".\n" +
            "Over the course of her childhood, with her father having been unable to obtain her a master,[52] Katara taught herself basic waterbending techniques and managed to master some simple waterbending forms.[8][13] This was a difficult feat, considering she would have never had the chance to have observed any waterbending in practice.[14]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara waterbends\n" +
            "Katara showed promising potential of being a prominent waterbender.\n" +
            "As of the discovery of Aang at the South Pole, Katara was capable of \"pushing and pulling\" water, streaming small amounts and manipulating it into basic forms and movements,[13] and was beginning to gain some control over the ability to change its physical state, freezing it into ice,[47] as well as attempting to create sizable waves of water. What little she knew, she taught to Aang, who quickly mastered all she had to offer. That which had taken her years to achieve, Aang managed to imitate and outperform her within mere minutes, much to her envy and frustration.[13]\n" +
            "Her waterbending remained amateurish at best until she came across a Northern Water Tribe waterbending scroll depicting several different traditional waterbending forms, among a collection of wares in a pirate-traders ship. Unable to afford the high price demanded for the scroll by the pirates, yet incapable of passing up such an opportunity to finally have formal instruction in waterbending, she deftly stole the scroll and eventually made away with it. Katara and Aang first learned the water whip technique from the scroll,[13] and afterward continued to improve their overall technique. Up until their arrival at the Northern Water Tribe, both Katara and Aang demonstrated considerable improvement, and Katara's confidence in her own abilities increased dramatically.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Later, Katara demonstrated the ability to bend with much greater precision and ease compared to when she first stole the scroll. She was able to draw unseen water out of different sources and bend greater quantities in general, streaming them into powerful blasts and freezing water with much more control than before.[47][53] She later developed several of her own techniques, including cloud manipulation[54][55] and a hand-held variation on the water-whip technique.[14] Katara also demonstrated greater manipulation of ice and snow, as well as discovered her ability to heal.[56] In the time between her acquisition of the waterbending scroll and arrival at the North Pole, Katara's sheer determination and discipline saw her proficiency improve greatly, clearly surpassing that of Aang.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara's pride, strong-mindedness and sense of justice caused conflict with the traditions of the Northern Water Tribe, which forbade women from learning combat focused waterbending. Katara, furious at having traveled to the opposite end of the Earth, only to be denied instruction by irrational customs, challenged the master waterbending instructor of the Northern Water Tribe, Pakku, to a duel. Though she was undoubtedly no match for the master, she valiantly held her own, determined not to be beaten. She demonstrated not only more advanced techniques than she ever had previously, but also a surprising amount of agility and skill in physical combat, as well as greater proficiency in basic waterbending techniques she had previously learned. For the first time, she was seen bending with her feet, employing nonbending hand and foot strikes in combat, and transforming the physical state of a wave. Pakku eventually removed her ability to bend by trapping her body and limbs between spikes of ice, and so won the fight without harming her. Though he admitted that she was an exceptionally talented waterbender, he rigidly stuck by the laws of his culture and refused to teach Katara.[14]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "At the fight's conclusion, Pakku discovered Katara's necklace which had broken off during their duel. Recognizing the carved pendant, he revealed that the necklace had originally been given to Kanna by himself as a symbol of their engagement sixty years prior. After realizing Katara was the granddaughter of his ex-fiancÃ©e, who had left the Northern Water Tribe to escape their arranged marriage, he decided to instruct Katara in combative waterbending.[14]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Under the guidance of Master Pakku, Katara's waterbending abilities advanced quicker than that of any student he had ever trained, which he accredited to her fierce determination, passion and hard-work. She fought and defeated Zuko with the augmented power of the near-full moon. During the fight, she knocked him off his feet, deflected and shielded his attacks, imprisoned him in a dome of solid ice, and later, a wave of solid ice. Though she was defeated by Zuko after the sun rose, she fought him again with the full moon and defeated him easily.[50]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Following the Siege of the North, Pakku declared Katara a full-fledged waterbending master.[15]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara stops her attack\n" +
            "Katara's waterbending was exemplary, as she could turn rain drops into weapons.\n" +
            "Katara continued to hone her waterbending potential, regularly demonstrating her waterbending mastery in battle. In Omashu, Katara blocked a flurry of Mai's knives by waterbending wooden boards into the air as shields in front of herself. She managed to block Mai's hand arrows with ice and retaliated by freezing Mai's arm in ice. Ty Lee sneaked behind Katara and blocked her chi, preventing her from waterbending.[41] While in the swamp, Katara cut apart the vines holding her with the water stored in her pouch. In the battle where she, Aang, and Sokka fought against Huu, Katara created large waves in the swamp water, froze a part of the swamp monster, and created a coil of water that she used to blast a hole into the monster. She also created large round blades out of the water and used them to cut up Huu's monster.[57] Later, she easily defeated two earthbending students by freezing them in solid ice.[58]\n" +
            "When facing Ty Lee a second time, Katara fought using the water in her pouch to fend off her chi blocking attacks, forcing Ty Lee to cartwheel away from disks of razor-sharp water. She also stopped Azula from killing Aang by catching her hand in a water whip.[44] While crossing the Serpent's Pass, she made a bridge of ice for the group to travel across, and worked with Aang to support an underwater bubble for the group to travel in. She also surfed around on a surfboard of ice and, together with Aang, created a massive whirlpool to defeat the serpent.[40]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "She also rapidly condensed water vapor into ice to defeat her foes.[59] When assaulting Jet upon re-encountering him, she used ice spikes, similar to Mai's daggers, to pin Jet to the wall in an alley.[48] While fighting off the Royal Earthbender Guards, Katara defeated dozens of them with whips and streams of water.[60] In the Crystal Catacombs, Katara and Aang fought against Zuko and Azula. Katara managed to cut one of Azula's hair bangs with a water blade, and created two enormous whips of water, which she used to briefly trap Azula. Later, these whips were able to match Zuko's enormous fire whips. Finally, when Katara was surrounded by Dai Li agents, she defended herself with the octopus form, and rode on an enormous wave which knocked down these agents as well as Zuko. She proceeded to escape on a rising stream of water, carrying Aang to safety.[49]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara freezes Azula\n" +
            "Katara proved to be a formidable opponent, even against master benders such as Azula.\n" +
            "Katara's waterbending later became even more advanced and destructive. During a fight with a Fire Nation ship, Katara used a huge wave to separate the two ships and created a huge steam barrier between them for cover. Once their ship was hit by a harpoon, Katara used her frosty breath of waterbending to freeze the hole in the ship's hull, thus repairing it.[12] When Aang held a dance for some of his Fire Nation school friends, Katara also created a fountain out of solid ice for beverages, as well as the glasses they used to drink from.[55] At the Jang Hui River, Katara created a cover of steam and sped herself atop the water's surface. Assisted by Aang, she used crashing waves and precise missiles of water to destroy a Fire Nation Army factory. She also blasted a Fire Nation river craft into the air and against a cliff.[1] Katara also transported a huge bubble of water from a nearby creek to extinguish a fire.[61] When Combustion Man locked Katara and Toph in jail, Katara used her own sweat as a water knife to break out of a wooden prison cell.[19] During Katara's time hiding within the Fire Nation, she met an elderly woman named Hama, who turned out to be a fellow waterbending master from the Southern Water Tribe. After learning this, Hama began training her in Southern Style waterbending. Among many techniques and combat tactics, Katara became able to condense moisture in the air to create her own water source for her bending, as well as becoming aware she could remove water from plant life.[42]\n" +
            "On the Day of Black Sun, Katara fought against the Fire Nation guards at the capital, destroying several guard towers with Sokka and defeating many soldiers.[62][63] At the Western Air Temple, she rained ice spikes onto Combustion Man.[46] While tracking down her mother's killer, she used the enhanced power of the full moon to nearly take down a whole Fire Nation ship of the Southern Raiders single-handedly. During her encounter with Yon Rha, Katara created a large wide dome of water by gathering rainwater and created ice spikes from it, nearly killing him.[11] Finally, during Sozin's Comet, she froze herself and Azula into a block of solid ice, thawed the center of it, and chained Azula to a grate.[10]\n" +

            "Katara heals her hands\n" +
            "Katara used her waterbending abilities as a remedy.\n" +
            "Katara's innate aptitude toward waterbending abilities made her a rare case to also naturally have access to the incredible ability to heal by manipulating the chi paths in a person's body, including herself. She inadvertently discovered this ability after Aang accidentally burned her hands, and subsequently used this power again to heal Aang's own burn after his face-off with Admiral Zhao.[56] Once she reached the Northern Water Tribe, she further developed this ability by training with Yugoda.[14]\n" +
            "With the aid of a small vial of spirit water, which held special properties, from the Spirit Oasis, Katara's healing abilities were enhanced.[64] Katara was going to use the spiritual water from the Spirit Oasis in an attempt to heal Zuko's scar, but Aang and Iroh burst in, making Zuko angry at Iroh for allying with the Avatar. Instead, she later used the spirit water to bring Aang back to life after he had been struck in the back by Azula's lightning.[49] Katara unsuccessfully attempted to heal Jet after he was fatally wounded by Long Feng.[48] During the invasion, Katara's father, Hakoda, was injured while taking out a Fire Nation ballista tower. Aiding him, her healing was enough to allow him to walk again.[62] During Azula and Zuko's Agni Kai, Azula generated lightning and aimed it at Katara rather than Zuko; however, Zuko jumped in front of Katara and let the lightning shock him instead, sparing her from near death.[65] After chaining Azula to a water grate, Katara used her healing to aid Zuko. Her healing had been successful enough that he could rise to his feet just moments after she had begun.[10]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As an adult, her prowess continued to grow, as she became well-recognized in her abilities throughout the world. She proved herself to be an excellent waterbending teacher, having trained her daughter and both Avatars Aang and Korra to become highly adept masters themselves, including teaching Korra the art of healing. However, even though her healing skills were recognized to be \"the best in the world\", she could not restore Korra's bending after Amon severed the connection Korra had to the three elements other than air with his bloodbending.[16]\n" +

            "Katara bloodbends ship captain\n" +
            "Katara bloodbent the Southern Raiders commander.\n" +
            "After learning all of Hama's Southern Style skills, Hama decided to teach Katara bloodbending, an advanced ability to manipulate the water within the body of all living beings, controlling them like puppets. When Katara refused to learn such a technique, viewing it as dark and immoral, Hama decided to silence her with the said technique. Despite only just hearing about the skill, Katara showed an innate talent for the art, quickly becoming the first person to break the effects of Hama's bending grip and free herself. Ultimately however, Hama tricked Katara into utilizing bloodbending to save Sokka and Aang, leaving her greatly distressed.[42] Sometime later, Katara traveled with Zuko to hunt down the man who killed her mother, Yon Rha, the captain of the Southern Raiders. The night they arrived at the Southern Raiders' ship, under the full moon, she alone took out nearly the entire crew. When she discovered where the captain was, she let her anger take over and started using bloodbending on him, which stunned Zuko. When she looked into his eyes and discovered that he was not the one, she released him, shocked and dismayed that she had just used bloodbending on an innocent person. Though this was the last known time she used the technique, she came to greatly understanding its workings, as she was able to determine how Amon had used bloodbending to remove Korra's bending. Later on in life, Katara saw to it that bloodbending was made illegal in the United Republic.[11]\n" +

Katara was also versed in midwifery, demonstrated in her crucial role in delivering Tahn and Ying's baby, Hope.[40]\n" +

As the daughter of a nobleman, she attended the Royal Fire Academy for Girls with her friends, Princess Azula and Mai. As a child, Ty Lee dealt with six sisters who shared identical appearances with her. This caused her to feel a loss of individuality, and led her to have a longing to be a unique, recognizable person, and a desire for attention from other people.[1] Because of this, after she matured, she ran away from her home and joined a Fire Nation circus, becoming a skilled acrobatic performer and gaining more personal attention.\n" +
            "Ty Lee was a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, often utilizing chi blocking, a unique form of martial arts which targets pressure points located in the human body. By striking these, she was able to disrupt an individual's chi flow and temporarily paralyze them, thereby also preventing the victim from bending for a period of time. Mai and Ty Lee were recruited by Princess Azula to hunt down and capture Prince Zuko and Iroh, and later Avatar Aang and his friends.[5]\n" +
            "Mai later betrayed Azula to save Zuko's life, and when the infuriated princess retaliated, Ty Lee defended Mai by paralyzing Azula, which led to her imprisonment.[6] While in prison, she met the Kyoshi Warriors for a second time and befriended them. In return for teaching them how to chi block, they allowed her to join their group. Upon their release at the end of the Hundred Year War, Ty Lee adopted their makeup and clothes, effectively becoming part of a matched set once again.[7]\n" +

            "Born into a Fire Nation noble family in 85 AG, Ty Lee was one of seven identical sisters, the others being Ty Lin, Ty Lat, Ty Lao, Ty Liu, Ty Lum, and Ty Woo. In order to preserve a sense of individuality, the sisters each chose a different hobby and agreed to stay away from each other's so their parents could not compare them with one another.[8] Despite that, Ty Lee still felt like she was part of a matched set and constantly had to compete for attention, often feeling neglected by her surroundings. She attended the prestigious Royal Fire Academy for Girls where she met Azula and Mai, with whom she developed a close friendship.[1][5] Due to her friendship with the Fire Nation princess, Ty Lee was allowed to play with Mai and Azula at the Fire Nation Royal Palace. During one of those outings, Ty Lee demonstrated her superior acrobatic skills by performing a series of cartwheels and somersaults, which Azula proved unable to mimic. As a result, Ty Lee was pushed to the ground by a jealous Azula, who subsequently laughed at her. Despite her indignant reaction to the princess's behavior, Ty Lee happily went along with Azula's plan to humiliate Mai and Zuko, on whom Mai had a crush. After Azula orchestrated a situation in which Mai and Zuko fell into a fountain, Ty Lee teased the pair about being \"cute\" together.[9]\n" +

            "After Ty Lee ran away to join the circus, Azula tracked her down and attempted to recruit her to assist with the capture of the now-fugitives, Zuko and Iroh. Ty Lee, however, was happy and at peace with her lifestyle, claiming that her \"aura [had] never been pinker!\" Azula, in an ostensibly friendly gesture, informed Ty Lee that she would attend that night's performance before leaving, while Ty Lee seemed rather uneasy and nervous about this. During the performance, Azula ordered the ringmaster to set the net beneath Ty Lee's tightrope ablaze and to release an assortment of dangerous animals, increasing the peril for Ty Lee should she fall.\n" +
            "Afterward, when Azula told her she was looking forward to the next day's show, Ty Lee informed Azula that she would not be performing, due to the fact that \"the universe was giving [her] strong hints that it was time for a career change.\" When Mai later asked her about the circus being her calling, Ty Lee noted that \"Azula called a little louder.\" She accompanied Mai and Azula during a hostage trade to exchange King Bumi for Tom-Tom, Mai's younger brother. In the battle that ensued after Mai called off the trade per Azula's suggestion, Ty Lee handled herself well, using chi blocking to disable Katara's waterbending. She and Mai were eventually defeated when Appa knocked them off the platform on which they were fighting. As they were leaving the city, Ty Lee gently teased Mai once again about her affections for Zuko, noting that it would be \"interesting\" for Mai to see him again.[5]\n" +

When Sokka and Katara split from the Avatar, Ty Lee and Mai were charged with the task of tracking down the siblings. The two of them overwhelmed their targets easily but were promptly sent flying into a river by an air blast from Appa. Once out of the water, Ty Lee asked Mai if she too believed that Sokka was \"kind of cute\".[10]\n" +
            "Ty Lee, Mai, and Azula oversaw the attempt to breach the walls of the Earth Kingdom capital, Ba Sing Se. When the Terra Team was sent out to slow the drill, Azula ordered Mai and Ty Lee to deal with them. With the help of her companion, Ty Lee made quick work of the team, blocking their chi and rendering them disabled. Later, when Aang, Katara, and Sokka were found sabotaging the drill, Ty Lee once again acknowledged Sokka particularly, this time sending him a flirtatious look, to which Sokka responded with some light flirting of his own. When Azula sent Mai and Ty Lee after the fleeing siblings, Ty Lee followed them into the slurry waste pipeline. However, Katara and Toph bent the water and rock mixture, using it to plug up the waste tunnel while Ty Lee was trapped in it, thus thwarting her attempt to catch them. During this, Katara was presumably embittered toward Ty Lee because of her ability to impair bending and aggressively insulted Ty Lee, calling her a \"circus freak\". After the drill was destroyed, Ty Lee was launched out of the pipeline by the build-up of pressure and slammed into a rock platform, but was more or less unharmed.[11]\n" +

During the battle, she showed concern over her physical appearance when she remarked that she and her friends were more attractive than the warriors they were fighting.[12]\n" +
            "After Team Avatar departed from Ba Sing Se, Earth King Kuei gave an audience to three impostor Kyoshi Warriors, who were later revealed to be Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee in disguise. The girls used their false identities to aid their infiltration into the Earth Kingdom city, fooling both the Earth King and Team Avatar. Eventually, however, Katara rushed in with important news. She stated that Zuko and Iroh had entered the city, to which Azula responded that she would be sure to let the Earth King know. Katara quickly saw her gold eyes, recognizing them as Azula's, and prepared to attack the group. However, Ty Lee suddenly attacked Katara with a chi block, therefore allowing the trio to easily capture her.[13]\n" +

            "After a successful coup against the government of the Earth Kingdom orchestrated by Azula, Ty Lee remarked playfully how cute Sokka was. While fighting Sokka, she claimed it was as if they were dancing. Ty Lee was last seen trying to teach the Earth King's bear, Bosco, how to do a handstand. While in the process of doing this, Toph earthbent her hands and feet to the floor, rendering her immobile.[14]\n" +

At the beach, Ty Lee soon found herself being approached by a boy who helped her unpack and stood over her to provide her with shade. Not long after, another boy came with a seashell to present to Ty Lee as a gift. In no time at all, Ty Lee was surrounded by many admirers. During a kuai ball match, she attracted the attention of two boys, Chan and Ruon-Jian, who invited Ty Lee and Mai, and more reluctantly, Azula and Zuko, to a party that night.\n" +
            "During the party, Ty Lee was surrounded by the boys from the beach and many others and was forced to paralyze them with chi blocking to escape the crowd. Seeing this, Azula called Ty Lee a \"tease\" and said that none of the boys really cared about her. Ty Lee immediately started crying, clearly upset, and Azula hurriedly apologized and confided that she said those things because she was actually a little jealous of Ty Lee's popularity. Azula asked Ty Lee how to make boys like her and Ty Lee admitted that boys might be intimidated by Azula. Ty Lee advised her friend to act as if she was interested in whatever the boy was saying and to laugh frequently. Zuko was later kicked out of the party and Mai, Azula, and Ty Lee came down to the beach to find Zuko. After starting a campfire, Zuko mocked Ty Lee as a \"circus freak\". She subsequently revealed tearfully that she had six sisters who looked identical to her and that she had gone to the circus to have individuality. Because of her experiences, \"circus freak\" was a term she regarded as a compliment. Mai replied that the reason Ty Lee craved so much attention was because she received so little as a child.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The group subsequently began to open up to one another. With all their secrets revealed, the heaviness between the four seemed to vanish. Ty Lee commented that she would remember that night forever and that Lo and Li were correct about the beach's ability to reveal people's true selves. To celebrate their revelations, Azula decided on a fitting end to their night â€“ the four later headed back to Chan's party, trashing the house and leaving it a ransacked mess. Together, the four of them forged their own memory of the place, uniting as friends for the first time in years.[1]\n" +

            "Ty Lee made another appearance when she assisted Azula at the Boiling Rock maximum-security prison. She and Azula confronted Sokka, Suki, Zuko, Hakoda, and Chit Sang, a firebending prisoner. Suki, well aware of Ty Lee's chi blocking techniques by this point, took great care to evade her attacks. When the guards were about to cut the line on the gondola in which Suki, Hakoda, Sokka, and Zuko were escaping, Ty Lee and Azula, who were dueling the escapees, jumped onto a passing gondola. Immediately after this, Ty Lee wore an unsure and anxious look on her face â€“ either for Sokka, hinting that she may still have had some feelings for him, or for Zuko, her old childhood friend.\n" +
            "Back at the Boiling Rock, she saw Mai double-cross the Fire Nation guards. After some tension and an argument between Azula and Mai, the two prepared to attack each other. Azula was getting ready to attack Mai when Ty Lee turned against her as well, attacking her by blocking her chi and paralyzing her to protect Mai. Ty Lee quickly urged her dumbfounded friend to leave the scene, but they were arrested before they were able to flee. Azula ordered the guards to lock the two away and \"let them rot\", not wanting to be in their presence ever again as a punishment for their unfaithfulness.[6] These events severely weakened Azula's mental state and played a part in her eventual defeat and nervous breakdown at the hands of Zuko and Katara.[7]\n" +

            "Ty Lee and Mai were locked up at another prison, where they met the rest of the Kyoshi Warriors, until the defeat of Fire Lord Ozai during the coming of Sozin's Comet. While in prison, Ty Lee befriended her old enemies and gave them some lessons in chi blocking, which led to their bonding.[7] After they were let out of prison, Ty Lee felt that the world was broken due to the war and wanted to help rebuild it, so she decided to join the Kyoshi Warriors.[8] Together with her new comrades, she appeared on Fire Lord Zuko's coronation day in a Kyoshi Warrior uniform, elated to be a part of the warrior order. Sokka became hysterical, initially believing that Ty Lee was impersonating a Kyoshi Warrior again, but they explained their bonding while in prison, which proved to be enough to calm him.[7]\n" +
            "101 AG\n" +
            "A year after the end of the Hundred Year War, Mai asked Ty Lee and the rest of the Kyoshi Warriors to protect the Fire Nation Royal Palace after an attempt by Kori to murder Fire Lord Zuko. The first night they were standing guard, Zuko woke up in the middle of the night and went outside. Suki and Ty Lee assured him that it had been quiet all night. Zuko apologized, saying that he did trust the Kyoshi Warriors as the best guardsmen in the world, to which Ty Lee cheerfully answered \"guardswomen, you mean!\"[15]\n" +

            "After the resolution of the conflict in Yu Dao, Ty Lee and Suki were tasked to keep an eye on Azula and Ozai when they were placed into adjoining cells in order to facilitate conversation about Ursa's whereabouts. When Zuko entered Azula's cell and was subsequently attacked by his sister, Ty Lee did not hesitate to chi block her former friend, incapacitating her from further action. Azula recognized her and started asking nonsensically how \"she\", referring to Ursa, managed to turn the fear Ty Lee and Mai had for her, though Ty Lee brushed it aside, saying that she was not making any sense. After they all left the cell as requested, Ty Lee admitted that Azula was wrong, as she had never stopped fearing Azula.\n" +
            "Ty Lee later greeted Team Avatar when they arrived at the Fire Nation Royal Palace, and saw them off the next day as they took Zuko and Azula to Hira'a to track down Ursa.

            "While still residing at the Fire Nation Capital, Ty Lee began to feel down for reasons unbeknownst to her, causing her to skip one of the Kyoshi Warriors' training drills. Being approached by Toph, she admitted that she needed a break as nothing felt right to her anymore. Upon revealing that her aura was off, she was dragged off to a Fire Nation circus, which she quickly recognized as her former workplace after seeing the circus master. When Ty Lee greeted her former employer, he wondered what she was doing there, considering the show was scheduled to start five minutes later, and pushed her into a nearby tent, ordering her to get dressed.\n" +
            "Ty sisters argue\n" +
            "As the man left and Toph entered, Ty Lee was surprised to find her six identical sisters inside the tent. After introducing them to Toph, the Ty sisters, ecstatic to see each other again, embraced. Despite the joyful reunion, Ty Lee became upset to learn that her sisters all joined the circus, performing as the \"Flying Ty Sisters\", and argued that acrobatics had always been her defining trait, something they had promised to stay away from so their parents would not be enticed to compare them to each other. An argument quickly ensued, however, when Ty Liu and Ty Woo each claimed that Ty Lee had stolen the hobby from them. As more joined in, an unnerved Ty Lee stormed out of the tent. Despite her intention to leave, Toph managed to convince her to stay and attend the platypus bear show with her.\n" +
            "During the performance, Ty Lee figured out that she had been down because being part of the Kyoshi Warriors was just like her home life as part of a matched set, several people looking and acting the same. Not wanting to be in that situation again, she decided to quit the order. As the announcer introduced her sisters as the next act, Ty Lee grew annoyed and quickly left the tent with Toph. On their way out, Toph noticed two men plotting to burn down the circus. While the earthbender challenged the firebending assailant, Ty Lee attacked the other man. Despite kicking the large man directly in the chest, the attack left him unfazed. Before he could do anything, however, Ty Lee was saved by her sisters, who defeated him together. Thanking them for their help, Ty Lee hugged her siblings, commenting that it was a good thing they had become acrobats after all.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Ty Lee hugs Kyoshi Warriors\n" +
            "Upon returning to the capital, Ty Lee redonned her Kyoshi Warrior outfit, much to Suki's excitement, who had been told by Toph that she was quitting the team. Ty Lee responded by saying that hanging out with her sisters made her realize there were advantages to being part of a matched set, as some problems were too big to tackle alone. When Suki asked why she did not stay with her family then, Ty Lee answered that the warriors were her sisters too and added that she did not always have to match with them as she could take off her makeup whenever she wanted.[8]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "Ty Lee was bubbly and outgoing, yet slightly airheaded. She was a direct contrast to Azula's cruelty and Mai's constant torpor. She took delight in her acrobatic abilities, never missing an opportunity to show them off, and often craved attention and recognition, a result of her upbringing as part of an identical set of seven sisters. These attention issues also caused her to be a bit of a flirt, which is why, according to Mai, she needed the affection of multiple boyfriends.[1]\n" +
            "Ty Lee showed a strong sense of loyalty to her friends, Mai and Azula. Despite her obvious differences from Mai, she had a deep respect for her, and they often made an effective fighting duo, teaming up numerous times against their enemies. Ever since childhood, Ty Lee also considered Azula as a friend, but as she got older, that loyalty seemed to have been out of fear of the princess. When she first refused Azula's request to join her search for the traitorous Zuko, Azula persuaded her by endangering her life during a circus performance. For some time, Ty Lee never disobeyed Azula's orders. However, her breaking point came at the Boiling Rock, during Azula's attempted murder of her own brother and Ty Lee's childhood friend, Zuko. When the rope holding Zuko's gondola was about to be cut, which would send Zuko along with several prisoners and friends plummeting to their deaths, Ty Lee showed concern while Azula smirked next to her. After Mai helped Zuko and his friends escape the prison, Azula threatened her life. Fearing for Mai's safety in the face of Azula's terrible rage, Ty Lee attacked Azula, finally conquering her own fears and taking a stand against her \"friend\" after months of obedience.[6]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Ty Lee was known not to hold grudges against her enemies despite their encounters on the battlefield. She bonded with the Kyoshi Warriors, for whose confinement she was partially responsible,[12] establishing a fairly strong friendship with the group while they were imprisoned together.[7] She also showed affection for Sokka, despite the enmity between her allies and Team Avatar.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Ty Lee displayed great affection toward animals. In Ba Sing Se, she taught Bosco acrobatic moves before Toph earthbent her to the ground.[14]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Ty Lee sometimes came off as superficial, as seen when she affirmed her beauty to a Kyoshi Warrior[12] and when she warned her friends about the risk of getting acne from the negative energy surrounding their serious conversation.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Abilities\n" +
            "Ty Lee was extraordinarily agile. Even as a child, she was able to execute mid-air somersaults and cartwheels that surpassed even Azula's. Her agility continued to improve with age and she was commonly seen walking around in a headstance on just her fingers. She later developed remarkable acrobatic abilities, which allowed her to join the Fire Nation circus and perform high-wire acts with balance and grace. People traveled for miles to see her perform.[17] Because of this, she was fast and agile in battle, able to outmaneuver almost any opponent she came across and jump exceptionally high and far, even from a stationary position. Her abilities allowed her to dodge the attacks of dozens of powerful earthbenders, who were unable to land a hit on her.[11] She was also limber; able to twist, bend, and contort herself into positions nearly impossible for an ordinary person to achieve. These abilities also granted her impressive parkour and free-running skills, allowing her to scale almost any surface or terrain quickly and squeeze through most barriers and small spaces with noticeable ease.\n" +
            "Chi blocking\n" +
            "Another of Ty Lee's defining abilities was her mastery of pressure-point-striking martial arts, or chi blocking. With her extensive knowledge of the human body, she could strike sequences of pressure points, immobilizing her enemies to various degrees. She had the ability to paralyze a single body part or an opponent's entire body. This technique allowed her to block certain chi paths in benders to compromise their abilities. This made her especially dangerous to benders who relied solely on their bending and possessed no secondary fighting skills. She was so powerful that she was able to defeat dozens of powerful earthbenders within seconds.[11] However, if her target had faced her before or was expecting her attacks, the effectiveness of her chi blocking decreased as her opponent took measures to prevent her from using the technique; Suki was able to avoid her attacks at the Boiling Rock,[6] and Katara[10] and Sokka[14] were also able to effectively counter her when facing her again.\n";

During the last year of the Hundred Year War, she became one of Princess Azula's main allies, and therefore one of Team Avatar's greatest foes, as well as Prince Zuko's love interest once he returned to the Fire Nation. As one of the most privileged girls in the Fire Nation, she attended the Royal Fire Academy for Girls[3] and became a friend of Princess Azula and Ty Lee at a young age.\n" +
            "Mai was exceptionally proficient at throwing stilettos, a self-taught skill she developed out of boredom. Using small knives similar to ninja shuriken[4] and spring-loaded stilleto holsters concealed in her robes, she was capable of besting numerous benders at once, despite not being a bender herself. She was recruited by Azula along with Ty Lee to capture the Princess' brother and uncle, as well as the Avatar and his friends.[5]\n" +
            "Mai outwardly resembled an impassive and apathetic teenager. A victim of her father's political aspirations since early childhood, Mai confessed she got anything she wanted from her parents so long as she was quiet, well-mannered and perfectly behaved.[6] This had a profound effect on her personality, as it was deeply ingrained in her to keep all of her feelings and emotions strongly hidden. The only time she was ever seen happy was in the presence of Zuko, whom she loved deeply.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The strength of her feelings toward Zuko was revealed when she saved him from Azula at the Boiling Rock. She confronted Azula, declaring that her love for Zuko outweighed her fear of retaliation. As a result of this betrayal, Azula imprisoned her, along with Ty Lee, who stopped Azula's attack by blocking her chi.[7] She was later released after Zuko defeated Azula and claimed the throne. They restarted their relationship with a kiss before Zuko's coronation as the new Fire Lord,[8] though Mai broke up with him a year later.[9]\n" +
            "Mai was born in the Fire Nation. She was an only child for thirteen years and was given whatever she wanted, as long as she behaved. Her parents were strict and they constantly required her to stay silent and behave perfectly, which in later years led to her emotional distance.[6] She greatly despised her life in the Fire Nation, to the point that she would throw knives at her wall out of boredom, a habit that eventually allowed her to develop a skill in fighting with weapons.[10] She later attended the Royal Fire Academy for Girls and became friends with Ty Lee and Azula, who noticed Mai's skill with knives.[5]\n" +
            "One particular day, when she was about ten years old, Mai sat off by herself under a tree, looking disinterested as Ty Lee and Azula played together and did cartwheels. However, she did show marked interest in Zuko, turning away shyly and blushing when he walked by with his mother. Azula noticed this and took Mai's obvious crush, which Azula later revealed to have been mutual, as a cue to humiliate both Zuko and Mai. Mai was ordered to balance an apple on her head which Azula set aflame. Zuko was subsequently tasked to knock it off her head, though the entire scheme ended up with both of them falling into a fountain on top of each other, much to the amusement of Azula and Ty Lee.[11]\n" +

            "Before joining Azula, Mai unwillingly resided in the newly conquered city of Omashu with her mother, infant brother, Tom-Tom, and her father, the Fire Nation-appointed governor of the city-state. Mai described Omashu as \"unbearably bleak\" to her mother and complained of how bored she was, stating that she was even more bored than she was back in the Fire Nation. Welcoming the distraction, she did not hesitate to go on the attack when the Omashu Resistance failed in their attempt to crush her and her family under a boulder. Thinking Aang and his friends were responsible, she pursued them until the resistance helped them escape.\n" +
            "Soon after, Azula arrived in the city, with Ty Lee in tow, to recruit Mai to assist her on a special mission. Desperate to get out of Omashu, Mai agreed to this immediately even though she had not been told what that mission was. Before leaving, however, Azula appointed Mai, in lieu of her father, to oversee a pre-arranged hostage trade: King Bumi for Tom-Tom, her baby brother, who wandered out of the city with a group of fleeing citizens and was subsequently assumed \"kidnapped\" by the resistance. However, right before Mai began the transaction, Azula interrupted, coyly suggesting that trading a powerful earthbender king for a two-year-old was strategically unwise. After a measured pause, Mai agreed and declared the deal off, thus initiating a fight between the two sides. Initially, she was overwhelmed by Katara's waterbending skills until Ty Lee blocked her opponent's chi. Mai was about to finish Katara off before Sokka knocked her weapon away with his boomerang. Later, as Mai, Azula, and Ty Lee were leaving the city, Mai confirmed, impassively, that their mission was to \"track down\" the now-fugitive Zuko and Iroh, though Azula noted that they also had a third target, Aang.[5]\n" +

When a group of elite earthbenders attempted to stop the drill, Azula sent Mai and Ty Lee to face them, which elicited approval from Mai as it was something to do. However, when Azula sent Mai and Ty Lee after Sokka and Katara, who were caught trying to sabotage the drill from the inside, Mai refused to chase them into the slurry pipeline, stating that despite how much lightning this act of defiance might cause Azula to throw at her, she would not go into that \"wall sludge juice\"â€”which gave the impression that Mai was not scared of the princess. Later, Aang destroyed the drill by causing the slurry pipeline to back up and explode, thus covering everyone in the general vicinity in slurry. After this, a completely pristine Mai leaned out of a hatch and dryly announced to the sludge-drenched Ty Lee and Azula: \"We lost.\"[13]\n" +

            "While lingering in the Earth King's throne room, Mai and the group were surprised by Katara who ran in with news about Zuko and Iroh. Azula said she would tell the Earth King, but Katara realized who they were because of Azula's amber-colored eyes. Ty Lee paralyzed her with a chi strike before she could escape and the trio proceeded to capture the waterbender.[15]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "During the Coup of Ba Sing Se, Mai sat in the throne room with Ty Lee, apparently having been ordered to guard the Earth King's pet bear, Bosco, but did not care enough about her assignment to attempt to stop Sokka, Toph, and Earth King Kuei from retrieving the pet. She was so bored and restless from her duty that she let Toph, Sokka, and Kuei escape with the bear, stating, \"Just take the bear.\"[16]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Summer 100 AG\n" +
            "Mai and Zuko were later set up on a dinner date by Azula in a plan to persuade a reluctant Zuko to return home, playing off their childhood crushes on each other. However, the two caught on to the setup and decided to take a walk around Ba Sing Se. Soon after, they ran into Jin, who immediately recognized \"Lee\" and questioned who his companion was. Thinking quickly, Zuko sheepishly claimed that Mai was a friend from the circus, the knife thrower. Mai appeared to join in on the charade and decided to give a demonstration. After moving Zuko in front of a fountain and placing a fish from a seafood stand they had passed earlier on top of his head, she targeted and precisely pierced the fish with an icicle. Mai persuaded Jin to give it a try. Zuko was just barely able to avoid being impaled by the sharp piece of ice, falling backward into the fountain in the process. Leaning over the drenched prince, Mai wryly stated that now they were \"even\".\n" +
            "As he chased her down an alley, Zuko exclaimed that she could have gotten him killed, but Mai merely laughed it off. Zuko stopped to point out that she finally seemed to be enjoying herself, going on to say that he had missed seeing this side of her. Mai admitted that a lot had changed since the days when she \"used to throw mud in his face\", but not everything had changed; she proved this by kissing him softly. The next day, the two of them arrived at the ship to leave for the Fire Nation together.[17]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "To the Fire Nation\n" +
            "Mai was next seen having a brief moment with Zuko on the ship voyage home, where he expressed nervousness about how much things would have changed and whether or not he would be forgiven and welcomed home. She humorously replied that she had not asked for his life story, told him not to worry, and kissed him briefly before departing once more. Later, when Azula saw Zuko moping, she commented that he was acting like Mai, though she amended that, claiming that Mai had been unusually cheerful lately.[18] Later, Zuko and Mai were having a romantic picnic on an ocean side cliff and enjoying an orange sunset together. Mai hated the color and told Zuko so, but this only made him chuckle and state how beautiful she was when she hated the world. Mai told Zuko she did not hate him and he told her the same and they kissed. Their moment was interrupted by Azula, who wished to speak with Zuko alone. The two tried to ignore her until Azula told Mai to go help Ty Lee, who apparently needed help untangling her braid. Mai complied, but glared briefly at Azula as she passed.[19]\n" +
            "Vacation at Ember Island\n" +
            "Mai's relationship with Zuko went through a rocky period during a trip to Ember Island; Zuko became increasingly short-tempered and tactless around her, growing frustrated when shiny shells and ice cream failed to impress her, though Zuko did accidentally drop the ice cream on her thigh; he also became protective when Ruon-Jian took interest in her. When he shoved Ruon-Jian across a room, breaking a vase, Mai reprimanded him for being \"impatient, hot-headed, and angry\". He responded by saying that she has no passion for anything and that she is \"a big blah\". Stung by this, Mai softly and yet harshly said that their relationship was over and wordlessly watched him storm outside.\n" +
            "When Zuko met her on the beach, she greeted him in a conciliatory tone, but he rudely asked her where her \"boyfriend\" is, and she got angry again. She remained cold toward him when he joined her, Ty Lee, and Azula around a campfire for a discussion. When Zuko yelled at Ty Lee, Mai told him to leave her alone; he persisted, however, and Ty Lee finally broke the story of her childhood out to them. Considering her words, Mai theorized that Ty Lee needed \"ten boyfriends\" because she wanted to make up for the attention she missed as a child. Ty Lee angrily asked for Mai's story, saying that all she saw with Mai was a \"dingy, pasty, gray\" aura. Mai dismissed the idea of auras and sarcastically apologized to Zuko for not being as \"high-strung and crazy\" as the others. Zuko said that he would like it if she did not keep her emotions bottled up; Mai explained to everyone how her mother's control and her father's political career meant that she could not stand out as she wanted to as a child. Azula summarized this, saying that a controlling mother was why Mai was afraid of caring about anything and could not express herself. Mai snapped at Azula's attempt to be an emotional mediator, demanding to be left alone. When Zuko moved to calm her down, she angrily refused him again and said that his not having an easy life was no excuse for the anger he had been showing. She and the other girls pressured Zuko, asking at whom he was angry. When he admitted that he was angry at himself and confused about what was right and what was wrong, Mai saw him once again as the Zuko she loved. Moving to comfort him, she said he is the one thing she cares about. Mai kissed him again, reaffirming their relationship.[6]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "A happy relationship\n" +
            "Mai and Zuko were on much better terms in the weeks that followed. Mai had learned to express herself more often and Zuko often visited her at home, which was across from the palace. Zuko asked her what she would want from the world if she could have anything she wanted, when she wanted it, and she said that it would be a fruit tart with rose petals on top. Zuko requested a tart from his servants, and they went on to discuss the advantages and downsides of being royalty. Mai suddenly mentioned a war meeting that Azula had been invited to, assuming that Zuko was also going, but he had not been invited.\n" +
            "Zuko was annoyed that his father would invite Azula to the meeting as opposed to his true heir, despite the fact that Azula assured him that he was wanted there. Mai tried to cheer up Zuko by suggesting that he boss around some servants or that they have some more fruit tarts, but to no avail. The next day, they were hanging out again when a servant came in to say that Zuko was expected at the meeting. This cheered up Zuko and Mai a great deal. When the meeting ended, Mai was happy to hear that Zuko was allowed to sit by his father's right side, but he told her that even though he acted like the son his father wanted, he was not being himself. It was clear to her that he had more on his mind.[20]\n" +
            "A broken heart\n" +
            "Mai was not seen during the Day of Black Sun, as she and the rest of the people in the Fire Nation Capital had been ordered to evacuate. However, Zuko wrote a letter and left the message in her bedroom, stating that he was leaving to join the Avatar.[21] Zuko was clearly upset that he must leave her, but he told Sokka he did that in order to protect her since he became a traitor. He did not want her to get caught in the crossfire on his behalf, to be branded as a traitor along with him.\n" +
            "At the Boiling Rock, Zuko learned that the warden was Mai's uncle, who told him that he had broken Mai's heart when he had left her.[22] When the two met unexpectedly, Mai was in her characteristically irritated demeanor, but she had clearly been deeply hurt, and argued with Zuko about his motives for leaving. She also berated him for leaving only a letter as a good-bye, rather than having the courage to break with her to her face. Zuko attempted to explain himself, saying that it was necessary to save his country, but Mai did not agree with his intent, saying he was betraying it instead, and turned away from him as he tried to protest. When a riot started, a guard arrived with orders from the warden to protect her- although, as both she and Zuko stated, she did not need any protection. Zuko took advantage of this moment and locked both inside the room. Mai glared at Zuko tearfully through the view hole, and Zuko showed deep regret before he fled to help Sokka.[7]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Arrest\n" +
            "Later, during the escape, the guards were about to cut the line from the gondola that held Zuko, Sokka, Hakoda, Suki, Chit Sang, and the warden. The guards were attacked and stopped by Mai who, when questioned what she was doing, stated that she was \"saving the jerk who dumped [her].\" Reactivating the cable, she engaged the gondola guards in combat, outmatching them with her knives, darts and sheer agility.\n" +
            "Mai was eventually arrested and brought before an enraged Azula and a frightened Ty Lee. When she was asked why she did what she had done as she knew what the consequences would be, Mai scornfully replied that her love for Zuko was stronger than her fear of Azula, adding that the princess had thus miscalculated.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Enraged by this retort, Azula prepared to attack Mai with her firebending; despite knowing that Azula's lightning would quickly kill her, Mai answered the challenge, readying a shuriken to defend herself. Much to Mai's surprise, Ty Lee intervened by chi blocking Azula. The two friends were immediately apprehended by the guards, however, and Azula ordered them to be locked away.[7]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Release from prison\n" +
            "Mai and Ty Lee were locked up at another prison, where they met the rest of the Kyoshi Warriors, until the defeat of Fire Lord Ozai during the coming of Sozin's Comet. After the battle, Mai and Ty Lee were freed after Mai's uncle \"pulled a few strings\", and as that her boyfriend was the new Fire Lord. While they finally reunited with a kiss, she sternly told Zuko not to ever break up with her again before embracing him.\n" +
            "Mai had apparently made peace with Team Avatar since the Hundred Year War ended. She was seen in Earth Kingdom robes, enjoying the newfound peace with her boyfriend and Team Avatar in Ba Sing Se at the Jasmine Dragon. She joined Suki in a game of Pai Sho and later, joined the rest of the group in making fun of Sokka's amateur drawing; in Mai's case, his efforts made her resemble a man.[8]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After the Hundred Year War\n" +
            "When Fire Lord Zuko returned to Capital City from his trip to Yu Dao, Mai noticed how tired he was and asked him to tell her his problems since she was his girlfriend, to which Zuko answered that he would. Mai subsequently informed him that, in order to put his mind at ease, she had asked the Kyoshi Warriors, including Ty Lee, for help with the security of the palace after an attempted assassination of Zuko by Kori Morishita.[23]\n" +
            "However, Mai later found out through Suki that Zuko had been secretly visiting his father. Angered that she was being kept out of the loop of everything, Mai broke up with Zuko, saying \"You love your secrets more [than you love me]\".[9]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "New Ozai Society incidents\n" +
            "After their break up, she left the Fire Nation Royal Palace and accepted her Aunt Mura's invitation to work at her flower shop as her assistant. While working on a flower arrangement, a young man named Kei Lo entered the shop and started flirting with her. The two went out on a date together, sharing a meal at the local noodle shop.\n" +
            "Mai leaving Ukano\n" +
            "Mai leaving her defeated father, taking Tom-Tom with her.\n" +
            "When Kei Lo established that Mai had been downcast ever since she had broken up with Zuko, he led her to a meeting of the New Ozai Society. To her surprise, her father was the leader of the society, having propositioned Kei Lo to bring his daughter there. Mai was displeased to see him, even more so after he offered her to join them in their attempts to reinstate Ozai to the throne. As Zuko's former girlfriend, she could give the society the confidential information they would need to bring Zuko down. However, Mai picked up her brother, tied him on her back in a sash, and promptly announced that they were leaving, rejecting Ukano's offer. The society members moved to apprehend her, but they were no match for Mai, who swiftly dealt with them. Apart from her father, Kei Lo was the last man still standing. He did not fight her, instead trying to tell her that he really liked her, though she cut him off by knocking him out, declaring that to be the end of their date. She left Ukano in the middle of the wrecked meeting room. Afterward, she returned to her aunt's flower shop with Tom-Tom and stared at a picture of her and Zuko.[24]\n" +
            "After exposing her father's activities to her mother her family moved out and went to live with her aunt. She has also been meeting with Kei Lo who has been giving Mai information on the New Ozai Society. One night he meets up with her when she was with Ty Lee and told her the society was planning to assassinate Zuko when he returned home. She thanked him and said good bye. Ty Lee scolded her for using him like that.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "She was with Ty Lee when the New Ozai Society attacked Iroh, who was posing as Zuko. She and the Kyoshi Warriors defeated the attackers and saw a distress flair go off. They rushed to help Zuko and his family. She saw Kei Lo, who she did not trust that much. She spoke with her father about why he was doing this. Before she could get a direct answer he fled. One month later she was with Kei Lo who asked why she did not visit with her when she responded she was not attracted to casts. She later saw her brother being kidnapped by the Kemurikage. The next day she said that she saw them to the police who were confused by her claim. Zuko then appeared and confirmed her claim. She was startled by this and he said they needed the Avatar's help.[25]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Mai greeted Aang upon his arrival and informed him of Tom-Tom's abduction by the Kemurikage. Her explanation was just short when her father barged in, accusing her of being the reason Tom-Tom was kidnapped, as she had taken him from the safety of their home. Despite Kei Lo's protest, Mai believed her father's words though disagreed with his idea to implement a curfew and create a task force. Instead, she backed the Avatar's suggestion to investigate the events that actually took place regarding the kidnappings.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "She encountered Azula once again and they engaged in a confrontation, during which Azula commented that Mai had practiced her skills. Once they found the kidnapped children, Mai reunited with Tom-Tom. She later ended her relationship with Kei Lo.[2]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "Dark, brooding, stoic, and gloomy, Mai was usually bored by her circumstances and took little interest in anything around her. Her lack of emotion was due to the manner in which she was brought up by her politically-motivated parents. Her apathy tended to irritate others, such as when Zuko described her as \"just a big blah\", and when Ty Lee described Mai's aura as \"dingy and gray\".[6] Mai's lack of emotion and constant calm sharply contrasted Zuko's passion and temper.\n" +
            "Mai was also not easily intimidated; she was one of the few people not afraid of Azula. While aboard the Fire Nation drill, she vehemently refused to enter the slurry pipeline to pursue Sokka and Katara, unconcerned with the consequences of disobeying Azula's order.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "She never displayed any bigotry or xenophobia toward people of other nations, attitudes that were characteristic of much of the Fire Nation nobility, especially Azula.[13]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Like Zuko, Mai was against the idea of needless killing; more often than not, she chose to disable foes rather than outright kill them during battle. She generally achieved this by using her weapons to pin their clothes, usually the sleeves, to a vertical surface.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Despite her stoic nature, her strong relationship with Zuko tended to bring out her more passionate side. Azula took note of Mai's \"strangely good mood\" since Zuko's return to the Fire Nation.[19] When Azula started toying with them and mocked her boyfriend, Mai soothed him by assuring him that, even though she had trouble showing it, she did love him.[6] She expressed deep concern when Zuko fretted over why he was not invited to a war meeting hosted by his father.[20] Mai was devastated by Zuko's sudden departure from the Fire Nation and consequently harbored some resentment toward him, as evidenced by her bitter confrontation with Zuko in his prison cell at the Boiling Rock. Despite her hurt, however, she retained great affection for Zuko, aiding his escape from the prison and, in the process, betraying her loyalty to Azula; she later affirmed to the princess that she loved Zuko more than she feared the latter.[7] Unwilling to hold a grudge, Mai happily reunited with Zuko after the Hundred Year War ended.[8]\n" +
            "Abilities\n" +
            "Mai was a master markswoman, able to skillfully hit targets from a distance. This skill, also known as \"stilettos\", involved shuriken knives and hand arrows, a skill that apparently started with her throwing knives at her bedroom wall out of boredom.[26] She had a deadly accuracy with these weapons and used them to pin her opponents down, even if she or the target was moving, which also helped against benders as they primarily needed their hands and arms to be free to bend. Her expert marksmanship gave her enough strength to defeat powerful benders and multiple opponents.\n" +
            "While she usually pinned her opponents down with her stilettos, she had been seen throwing them in a way that would cause severe, and possibly fatal, injuries, such as when she attacked Aang and Katara,[5] and Toph.[16] Mai's excellent reflexes, speed, and agility, enabled her to incapacitate several prison guards[7] without killing or injuring them. She proved to be quite nimble; on several occasions she was able to leap across long distances and over high obstacles with little effort. She was also shown to be able to slide across surfaces on her side. When attacking the guards on the Boiling Rock, she was able to attack and dodge by throwing a knife and diving onto her side, gliding across the metal surface in one fluid motion. In addition to her shurikens and the arrow-like darts in her sleeve and ankle holsters, Mai was also proficient with a three-pronged, retractable sai dagger which she used for close combat.\n";
    public static String aanDesc1 = "Aang was a male Air Nomad born in 12 BG and the Avatar during the century-long conflict known as the Hundred Year War. His immediate predecessor was Avatar Roku,[6] and his immediate successor is Avatar Korra. As the Avatar of his time, he was the only person capable of using all four bending arts: airbending, waterbending, earthbending, and firebending. He was also one of a select few Avatars, and one of the first in many cycles[7] to learn the ancient art of energybending, and the first Avatar known to have actively used the technique.\n" +
            "Shortly before the beginning of the Hundred Year War, Aang was frozen in an iceberg for a hundred years; he later emerged, still biologically twelve years old, into a world engulfed by war.[8] During his absence, the Fire Nation had waged war upon the other nations and managed to completely wipe out the pacifistic Air Nomads. It fell to Aang, the last airbender and the Avatar, to end the War by mastering the other three elements and defeating Fire Lord Ozai. He remained a kind and goofy kid at heart throughout his year-long struggle, despite the overwhelming loss of his people and the heavy burdens he was forced to bear. After his victory over the Phoenix King, Aang began a romantic relationship with his close friend, Katara.[9] The couple eventually married and raised a family of three children: Bumi, a nonbender who became an airbender later in life, Kya, a waterbender, and the youngest, Tenzin, an airbender.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang was born to two Air Nomads in 12 BG. After selecting the Avatar relics from among thousands of toys, thereby inadvertently confirming his identity as the Avatar, he was taken away by the monks of the Southern Air Temple, who kept his position a secret from him.[10][11] As an Air Nomad, Aang traveled extensively around the world.[12][13] During his childhood, Aang was housed, raised, and educated at the Southern Air Temple, under the guardianship of Monk Gyatso, who served as his father figure, counselor, and tutor.[6] As a child, Aang was a member of the Air Scouts, where he learned essential skills such as how to tie reins to a bison's horns with the bison horn knot.[14] When Aang turned six years old, he and several other young Air Nomad boys were taken to the Eastern Air Temple where they each chose a sky bison as their lifelong companion. Aang approached his soon-to-be sky bison Appa and offered him an apple, which Appa accepted, thus marking the start of their deep and lifelong friendship.[15]\n" +
            "Aang was always able to excel at any new bending moves he learned; at the age of six, he was a better airbender than children twice his age, and by the age of ten, Aang had proven himself to be better than his own teachers.[16] For exhibiting prodigious talent with his native element, air, he earned airbending tattoos and the status of an airbending master at the age of twelve, making him the youngest airbending master in Air Nomad history[17] until 171 AG, when his granddaughter, Jinora, received her tattoos at the age of eleven.[18]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In his childhood, Aang also visited the other air temples, as evidenced by his obvious familiarity with the Western Air Temple,[19] as well as cities in the Earth Kingdom, such as Omashu, where he developed a lasting friendship with the good-natured but eccentric Bumi.[12] He even bonded closely with children in the Fire Nation, like Kuzon,[13] with whom he went searching for a dragon in the mountains and saved a dragon egg from poachers.[20]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Due to the signs of a possible war approaching, Aang was told about his status as the Avatar at age twelve, four years earlier than the traditional age of sixteen. Aang felt burdened by his status as the other children refused to play with him anymore and he came to spend more time practicing airbending with the monks. Monk Gyatso was the only one who showed understanding of Aang's burden, having been good friends with Avatar Roku, Aang's past life,[21] and tried to help ease Aang through the transition from childhood to adulthood by providing Aang with balance through fun during the upheaval in his life.[11]\n" +
            "However, Aang later discovered that he would be sent to the Eastern Air Temple in order to complete his airbending training far away from Monk Gyatso, whom the other monks thought was too soft on him. Afraid and confused, the young airbender ran away with his flying bison, Appa, though they became caught in a storm shortly after, which caused them to crash into the water. Aang saved himself and Appa from drowning by semi-consciously entering the Avatar State and freezing them both in a sphere of ice through a combination of airbending and waterbending.[11] The Avatar State kept him alive, albeit not fully conscious, in the iceberg for about a hundred years while the war raged on.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Winter 99 AG\n" +
            "One hundred years later, Aang was found and freed from the iceberg by siblings Katara and Sokka of the Southern Water Tribe.[8] He quickly befriended them and almost immediately attracted the attention of Prince Zuko, who was to capture him by order of his father, Fire Lord Ozai.[22] A newly formed Team Avatar set out to find a waterbending master who could teach Katara and Aang, evading Zuko's attempts to capture them on their journey to the North Pole.[23] While helping rid Senlin Village of Hei Bai, a spirit that was destroying their village, Aang crossed over to the Spirit World where he met Fang, the animal guide of his predecessor, Avatar Roku. He was instructed to visit an Avatar Temple on Crescent Island during the winter solstice so he could talk with Avatar Roku.[24] Despite a run-in with most of the Fire Sages, a group whose loyalty had reallocated to the Fire Lord, Aang managed to speak with Roku, who warned him about the impending arrival of Sozin's Comet, which would grant the Fire Nation enough power to win the War.[25]\n" +
            "Koizilla destroys the Navy\n" +
            "Aang, merged with the Ocean Spirit, drove off the Fire Nation Navy.\n" +
            "Roku urged Aang to master the three remaining elements before summer's end, when the comet was due to arrive, or no one would ever be able to restore balance to the world.[25] When Aang was later captured by Admiral Zhao, Zuko came to his aid under the identity of the Blue Spirit, freeing the former so that he could capture the Avatar himself.[13] Aang, Sokka, and Katara continued their travels to the Northern Water Tribe, all the while developing a tighter bond and Aang beginning to develop a crush on Katara. Upon the group's arrival at the Northern Water Tribe, Aang was displeased to learn that the waterbending master, Pakku, would not teach Katara, due to the tradition of not teaching females in combative waterbending. Instead, Katara learned how to heal injuries using water. However, she was able to change Pakku's mind, and they both began to learn under him.[26] The period of calm was brief, as Zhao[13] commanded an attack on the Northern Water Tribe with a large fleet of ships.[26] Aang found the situation overwhelming and decided to seek the guidance of the Ocean and Moon Spirits, patrons of the Northern Water Tribe.[1] Aang learned through a spirit named Koh that the spirits existed in the mortal world, but his physical self had been captured by Zuko while he was in the Spirit World. Aang's friends managed to rescue him, but not before Zhao arrived at the Spirit Oasis, the lair of the spirits, and killed the Moon Spirit, who was the source of power for all waterbending. Determined not to fail the Water Tribe, Aang merged with the Ocean Spirit and proceeded to wipe out all Fire Nation ships, winning the battle.[27]\n" +
            "Spring 100 AG\n" +
            "Aang and the others flew to an Earth Kingdom base, from where they were to be escorted to Omashu, but decided to travel alone as the general in charge tried to force Aang into the Avatar State.[28] Upon arrival, they learned that the city had fallen under Fire Nation control.[29] They evacuated the citizens from the city in order to sustain the resistance; but, in the process, the governor's son, Tom-Tom, followed them out. Team Avatar was sent a messenger hawk saying the governor would trade Bumi for Tom-Tom. However, Azula interfered and their attempt was called off. At that, Aang fought Azula, who deemed it her mission to capture him. Bumi told Aang that he needed to remain in Omashu and instructed the young Avatar to search for an earthbending master who waited and listened to the earth before attacking.[30] While in the city of Gaoling, the team learned about a tournament that housed the best earthbenders in the world which they attended, hoping to find a good earthbending teacher for Aang. After watching many rounds, they witnessed the final fight between one of the popular contestants and the current champion, a blind girl. During her match, Aang realized the girl was the same one he had envisioned while lost in the Foggy Swamp,[31] and noticed her technique of waiting and listening before attacking, thus easily defeating her opponent. The ringmaster offered a sack of gold pieces to anyone who dared to face the \"Blind Bandit\". Aang accepted that challenge in order to talk to the girl, but she ignored him.[32]\n" +
            "The group later learned that the girl was of the Beifong family and went to the Beifong estate, gaining entrance by having Aang introduce himself as the Avatar. He learned, however, that the earthbender, Toph, hid her ability from her family. When the two were kidnapped, Toph managed to fight off all the attackers, revealing her skill to her parents, and ran away from home in order to join Aang's group.[32] As earth is the element opposite of air, Aang went through some difficulties while learning earthbending but eventually got it.[33] While taking a small vacation, the group found Wan Shi Tong's library in the middle of the Si Wong Desert and learned valuable information on a solar eclipse that would leave the firebenders powerless. While sorting through the library's information, however, they lost Appa, who was captured by desert people[34] and sold.[15] After meeting the kidnappers, an enraged Aang entered the Avatar State and destroyed the tribes' sand-sailers when he learned of Appa's fate. Despite Appa's absence, the group knew their new goal was to tell the Earth King in Ba Sing Se about the eclipse as the day of the eclipse will be the perfect opportunity for the Earth Kingdom to invade the Fire Nation. After finding their way out of the desert and crossing the Serpent's Pass, the group discovered a giant Fire Nation drill trying to penetrate the Great Wall of Ba Sing Se.[35] General Sung was reluctant at first to accept the group's help, but after witnessing the quick defeat of his Terra Team at the hands of Ty Lee and Mai, he gladly accepted the Avatar's assistance. In a joint effort, the group managed to fight them off and destroy the drill.[36]\n" +
            "Aang struck\n" +
            "Upon reaching Ba Sing Se, Aang discovered that the city was secretly corrupt; true power did not lie with the Earth King, but with his adviser, Long Feng, who controlled the secret police, the Dai Li.[37] They learned of and infiltrated Long Feng's secret base, believing that he was holding Appa captive. After reuniting with Appa,[38] they stormed the palace and informed the Earth King of the solar eclipse and Long Feng's betrayal. After they convinced the Earth King, Kuei, his men searched Long Feng's office and found a message for Aang from Guru Pathik, who had tied it to Appa's horn.[15] The message requested that Aang meet Guru Pathik at the Eastern Air Temple to be taught how to control the Avatar State.[39] While there, Pathik helped Aang open all his chakras but one, the Thought Chakra. Aang struggled to unlock this one when he learned he had to let go of his feelings for Katara. During his attempt to do so, he envisioned her in danger and immediately returned to the city, blocking his chakra.[1] On the way back, he picked up Sokka and Toph and together they learned that Azula and her friends had infiltrated the city. After Aang freed Katara from the princess' imprisonment, they both fought Zuko and Azula in the Crystal Catacombs. Things took a turn for the worse when the Dai Li, now under Azula's command, arrived. Aang attempted to enter the Avatar State, but was struck down in the back with a lightning bolt fired by Azula. The severe attack rendered his seventh chakra impossible to re-open and killed him while he was in the Avatar State, severing the connection of the Avatar Spirit to the Avatar World and causing the Avatar to fall from the plane of existence. Katara caught Aang while he plummeted to the ground. A surprising intervention of Iroh allowed her to bring Aang's body to safety. While escaping the city on Appa, Katara used water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole to revive him, which restored the Avatar Spirit in turn, but his ability to use the Avatar State became inaccessible to him.[40]\n" +
            "Summer 100 AG\n" +
            "For several weeks, Aang was unconscious as he recovered from his injury. Mentally, he spent this time in the Spirit World, where he reconnected with his four previous incarnations to heal the Avatar Spirit.[41] However, upon his awakening, Aang had no memory of his long journey through the Spirit World and his meetings with his former lives.[42] Aang woke up to find himself aboard a Fire Nation vessel and sporting hair, believing that he had been captured. In actuality, Team Avatar and others had seized and were commandeering the ship and were headed toward the Fire Nation. Upon reaching the Fire Nation, the team prepared for the invasion, planned during the Day of Black Sun, when firebenders were at their weakest.[43] They were continually threatened, however, by Combustion Man, an assassin Zuko sent after Aang.[44][45][46] On the day of the eclipse, Aang, Sokka, and Toph went searching for Fire Lord Ozai, but were kept at bay by Azula for the entire duration of the eclipse. They decided to retreat to fight another day.[47]\n" +
            "Afterward, Team Avatar and the youngest members of the invasion force journeyed to the Western Air Temple, where they were confronted by Zuko, who wished to join their group. They initially rejected him, but when he helped them defeat Combustion Man, Aang accepted Zuko as his firebending teacher.[19] When Zuko lost touch with his inner fire, Zuko and Aang sought out the Sun Warriors to learn the original source of firebending and underwent a trial from the dragons Ran and Shaw that enhanced both firebenders' abilities.[48]\n" +
            "\n"+"Due to his Air Nomad belief in the sacredness of all life, Aang felt strong anxiety about the concept of killing Ozai.[49] When he left for an island off the shore of Ember Island, he met a lion turtle who taught him the art of energybending.[7] Armed with this knowledge, Aang went on to defeat the Fire Lord by taking away his firebending with this ability. He vowed at Fire Lord Zuko's coronation to help him restore peace to the world. After Zuko's coronation, Aang was seen in Ba Sing Se with his friends, where he and Katara began a romantic relationship with a passionate kiss.[9]\n" +
            "After the Hundred Year War\n" +
            "Following Team Avatar, Fire Lord Zuko, and Kuei's agreement to initiate the Harmony Restoration Movement which was officially announced to the Earth Kingdom people by the Earth King, Aang, and his friends took a ride on Appa to watch the celebratory fireworks. While on the sky bison, the concerned Fire Lord asked the Avatar to make a promise: if Aang saw that Zuko's behavior was mirroring Ozai's, the Avatar would end his former friend. Initially disbelieving, Aang sought advice from Katara, who nodded in approval, and hesitatingly accepted.\n" +
            "To help the Harmony Restoration Movement, Team Avatar aided in the relocation of Fire Nation colonials back to the Fire Nation, starting with more recent colonies. A year later, with the movement so far successful, Aang, Katara, and Sokka were assisting the colonials led by Mayor Nishi to move and adjust. After landing in the Fire Nation, however, the friends discovered that Zuko had withdrawn his support for the movement and was occupying the oldest colony, Yu Dao, eliciting the group to immediately travel there. On the way, Aang consulted with Avatar Roku, who reminded him that Zuko's request to end him if he became like his father should be honored, citing Zuko's intent in making the promise and also revealing that he should have ended Sozin when he had the chance. Despite Roku's advice, Aang decided to attempt to talk to his friend before taking any action.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang entering the Avatar State\n" +
            "After landing outside Yu Dao, the team encountered a massive protesting crowd that included several members of the Freedom Fighters, who offered their services to the Avatar. To their disappointment, Aang explained his intention to talk to Zuko and flew with Katara over the walls on his glider. However, in the courtyard, several Fire Nation soldiers ordered Aang to leave and attacked, refusing to listen to the Avatar's attempts at peace. Aang sank their commander into earth while dodging the other troops, but one fireball set caused his clothing to catch fire, prompting Katara to intervene. She single-handedly defeated the remainder of the soldiers until she was halted by Zuko. Aang ordered the Fire Lord to let her go, and he responded by ordering the Avatar to leave. Using airbending, the Avatar separated the two, leading Zuko to retaliate. Aang entered the Avatar State, intent on fulfilling his promise, until Katara was able to calm him down. The Fire Lord advised that they talk, to which Aang agreed in comic frustration. Zuko led Aang and Katara on a tour of Yu Dao, explaining that the city had been heavily integrated for over a century, the firebenders and earthbenders having worked together to transform a small village into a world leader in metalworking, and also one of the great cities and that after seeing the townspeople living together peacefully, he could not separate them. Aang was adamant about restoring harmony to the four nations, but Zuko declined. Katara proposed hosting a meeting with Kuei, to which both the Avatar and the Fire Lord agreed.\n" +
            "Aang left Yu Dao, speaking with Smellerbee before departing. Appalled that the Avatar was talking instead of fighting, she demanded the removal of the colonials and said that Aang had three days to make a compromise before the Freedom Fighters would take action. On Appa en route to Ba Sing Se, Aang thanked Katara for calming him while in the Avatar State and not allowing him to take Zuko's life.[50]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As they arrived in Ba Sing Se, Aang and Katara encountered two co-founders and presidents of the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club's Ba Sing Se Chapter. When they learned that the couple was searching for a place to stay, they offered them residence at their clubhouse. Aang gladly accepted and he spent the night and the following morning entertaining the girls by showing them some airbending moves and being flattered by all the attention. As he and Katara left for the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace, he noted to her that even though the girls were just part of a silly fanclub, they did make him feel for a moment like he was back home with his people.\n" +
            "After informing the Earth King about the present situation with Fire Lord Zuko in Yu Dao, Aang and Katara were presented with a richly filled dinner table to allow Kuei some time to think about the situation. When the King returned, Aang was shocked to learn that the King refused peace talks with Zuko and had decided to send his army to Yu Dao instead. Realizing that sending in the army would be seen as a declaration of war, Aang and Katara hurried back to Yu Dao in an attempt to persuade the Fire Nation colonials there to evacuate before they arrived.[51]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "On his way to Yu Dao, Aang and Zuko shared a dream where they stood on a cliff, with Roku's spirit behind Aang and Ozai's spirit behind Zuko. In the dream, Zuko told Aang about his troubles from being unable to decide what was right, which prompted Roku to advise Aang to fulfill his promise. Aang went into the Avatar State, but at the last minute Ursa appeared, crying behind Roku. Aang and Zuko both woke up to realize it was a dream.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When Aang arrived at Yu Dao, he told the Fire Nation residents to evacuate, but earthbenders and firebenders began attacking him and Katara. When he spotted one of the attackers fleeing, Aang followed him into an ax factory to discover that his attacker was Sneers. Sneers revealed to Aang that he met Kori Morishita and had begun a romantic relationship with her; he tried to persuade him to join the Yu Dao resistance. When Aang refused, Kori introduced the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club Yu Dao Chapter, whose members were dressed in traditional Air Nomad attire. Aang remarked on how the clothing that they wore looked just like the uniforms that students at the Western Air Temple used to wear. He remarked on how their painted airbending tattoos looked just like real airbender tattoos, only to discover that they were the same as genuine airbender tattoos; Aang became enraged by this, explaining that an airbender's tattoos had to be earned through years of practice, and that his culture was not a game.\n" +
            "Aang stormed off and went onto the roof of the building, where Katara found him. He stated that he figured out why the four nations must be separate: because the stronger nation always ended up hurting the weaker one. Katara tried to remind him what Guru Pathik told him about the four nations being really one and the same, but Aang retaliated, saying that he loved his culture and everything that made it unique. He concluded by stating the contradiction in his mind about feeling obligated to follow through with the Harmony Restoration Movement, but in doing so it would result in him killing Zuko, which went against Air Nomad dogma. Katara began telling Aang why she changed her mind about the Harmony Restoration Movement, but they were interrupted by the protesters, led by Smellerbee. The group of protesters began using a stone battering ram to try and break open the gate. Aang succeeded in stopping them, before realizing it was all a distraction so he would not notice a drill further along the wall that broke through the gates.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When the protesters met up with the Yu Dao resistance, Aang tried to calm them down, but to no avail, as both groups began attacking each other. However, moments later, Earth Kingdom troops arrived, led by General How, as well as Fire Nation soldiers, led by Zuko. General How tried to persuade Aang to end Zuko's life, stating an army with no leader is a dragon without a head, but Aang argued against this. When the armies of both nations began to fight, Aang entered the Avatar State; however, Katara pulled him out of it before long, leading him away from the battle. She finished explaining to Aang why she changed her mind, and stated that when she saw Kori and her family, she also saw her future with Aang, and went on to say that if the four nations had to be separate, they had to be as well. She told Aang to find a quiet place to figure the situation out, and that she would fully support whatever decision he decided to make. They kissed and Aang flew off.\n" +
            "Aang traveled to a rocky mountain and earthbent the rocks around him to form a shelter. He contacted Avatar Roku, who advised Aang to \"contemplate the world\" and also revealed to him that Zuko was his great-grandson. Aang meditated further upon this, and after some time, he entered the Avatar State, which sent a beam of light into the sky. He flew down to the colony and separated the ground between the troops of the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom. Zuko began to plummet to his death into the crevice between the separated lands, but Aang grabbed his hand to save him. After coming out of the Avatar State, Aang confronted Earth King Kuei and stated that Kuei was fighting not only Fire Nation, but also the Earth Kingdom itself, the Water Tribe, and an Air Nomad. The Earth King realized his mistake, and Zuko also realized his fight was not the work of his father's hatred, but the right choice all along, which caused the Fire Lord to faint and the conflict to end.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Four days later on the roof of the Jasmine Dragon, Aang connected once again with Roku, attempting to explain that when he contemplated the world, he did not picture a map or floating cosmic energy; he pictured all his friends and everyone he loved. Roku, however, chided the Avatar for again being indecisive and leaving the world's balance at risk. Aang spiritually disconnected from him, claiming the world had changed too much for Roku to guide him any longer. Moments later, Iroh informed Aang that Zuko was now awake, and they both went inside the building. Aang talked to Zuko about how he must meet with the Earth King because the colony could not be either Fire Nation or revert to being Earth Kingdom. Zuko told Aang to break off his promise to kill him if he became like his father because the struggle of figuring out what was right and wrong was something the Fire Lord could not escape. Zuko told Aang that he wanted to look for his mother, to which Aang encouraged him to do so. Later, Aang departed from the Jasmine Dragon to confront the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club. He told them that he would teach them the ways of the Air Nomads and dubbed them the \"Air Acolytes\".[52]\n" +
            "Sometime after the battle for Yu Dao, Aang attended a meeting together with his friends and several government officials at the home of the governor of Yu Dao to discuss the future of the city. A professor gave a lecture on ancient Earth Kingdom philosophies regarding the four nations, though it was of little interest to Aang, who believed that they should look for new ways to overcome the present diversities as opposed to going back to how it was. He was complaining about it against Sokka who also could not be captivated by the professor. The two friends were soon shushed by Katara who did want to pay attention. Aang swiftly apologized, before coming to his girlfriend's defense after Sokka called her boring.\n" +
            "Meanwhile, Zuko had snapped back to attention when the professor had made a comparison between how one treats their family and how one rules. Aang noticed this and asked if everything was all right, to which he received a recollection of how poorly Zuko's family hung together.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "A week later, Aang traveled to the Fire Nation Royal Palace together with Katara and Sokka upon Zuko's inquiry. Upon arrival, they were delightfully surprised when they discovered Iroh there as well. Zuko explained that Iroh was there to act as interim Fire Lord while he would be gone, looking for Ursa, a journey on which he invited Team Avatar to accompany him. The amicable atmosphere quickly changed, however, when Azula emerged from behind Zuko. Katara immediately attacked the princess, with Aang and Sokka preparing to do the same, though they were halted by Suki and Ty Lee, who implored them to let Zuko explain the situation to them. After the Fire Lord explained that Azula had been the one to coax the needed information from Ozai, and Iroh had pointed out that she too might find peace by finding her mother, Aang accepted the task and stated that he would accompany Zuko on his quest.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The following day, Aang was preparing Appa for the journey toward Hira'a when Azula arrived on the courtyard and haughtily commanded the ones present to take care of her bags. The young airbender calmed his bison, soothing him with the knowledge that the princess would only be with them for a short while, before tending to her luggage by airbending it atop Appa without complaining. When Azula subsequently zapped Sokka with her lightning, he was quick to trap her feet with his earthbending to prevent any further action. As the tension subsided, he released her again and they all set off on their journey.\n" +
            "Airborne, Aang sat on Appa's head with Katara by his side. When Sokka commented how the adventure felt like \"old times\", Aang corrected him by saying that it was better than old times, since he could now kiss Katara whenever, something he deftly demonstrated, much to Sokka's annoyance. The mood was broken, however, when Aang suddenly had a gruesome expression on his face, caused by the presence of a spirit. The Avatar spotted a wolf spirit running below him, but was the only one who could see the creature at that moment. Using the ensuing commotion, Azula said her goodbye and jumped off Appa, prompting Aang to dive after her and catch her, thus preventing her from plummeting to her death. The princess repaid him by setting his glider alight, sending him crashing down in order to facilitate her own escape. Apart from a singed glider, Aang was okay and followed Azula into the forest with the rest.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When they had caught up with the princess, Aang made his gruesome face again as the wolf spirit appeared as well. As the Avatar, he tried to reason with the spirit, apologizing for any possible disturbance, but to no avail as the spirit attacked. Aang implored his friends to take it easy with the spirit, specifically to avoid hurting it. When he tried to reason with the creature once more, the wolf snapped at him, prompting Appa to intervene and slam the spirit down with his tail. When Aang asked after the spirit's well-being, the entire group was attacked by a swarm of moth wasps the spirit had thrown up. They were eventually saved when Azula shot a lightning bolt away from them all, drawing the moths and the wolf spirit with it.\n" +
            "That night, Aang agreed with Katara and Zuko to each take turns watching Azula sleep. Awaiting his turn, he meditated.[53]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The next morning, Zuko took Aang away from the camp to show him the letter he had found hidden in Azula's boot, revealing that Zuko might not be Ozai's son. Perplexed by the revelation, Aang asked Zuko why Ozai did not do away with him, thus learning about Ursa's sacrifice. When he noticed that Zuko was relieved by the possibility, Aang grew worried that Zuko's claim to the throne was at risk. However, before they could talk it out, they were attacked by Azula, who demanded the return of the letter. Concerned about the safety of his friends, Aang left to check on Katara and Sokka after Zuko assured him he would be fine. When he arrived at the camp, he found it ablaze, with the Water Tribe siblings attempting to extinguish the flames. By the time he and Katara managed to smother the fire, Zuko had succeeded in calming his sister down, and the group continued onto Hira'a.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As they arrived at the outskirts of town, they all donned a disguise, with Aang covering his arrow tattoo with a headband. They were in time to catch the closing act of the Hira'a Acting Troupe's version of the play, Love amongst the Dragons. Once the play was over, Aang wondered what they should do now, prompting Zuko to start asking around about Ursa. This caught the attention of Noren, the director of the acting company, who invited them all to his home, where they could talk more freely. Aang and Katara complimented Noriko, Noren's wife, about their lovely home, and the Avatar asked how long they had been married. Noriko happily informed them that it had been nearly five years, subsequently embarrassing the young couple when she noted that they were perhaps a bit young to be already thinking about marriage, though she soon digressed, concluding that love was ageless. Under the cover of being drama historians, they did not get any new information regarding Ursa, but they did learn that Ikem left town, heading toward Forgetful Valley.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As the group returned to Appa, Aang spoke with Zuko regarding Ikem, stating it to be best if they did not track him down and burn the letter. He reasoned that it was important for the world's balance that Zuko remained on the throne, whether or not he actually had Ozai's royal blood flowing through his veins. The conversation was cut short, however, when Katara and Azula got into a heated argument.\n" +
            "The next day, the team ventured into the forest, making their way to Forgetful Valley. Aang was appalled by Azula when the Fire Nation princess burned a piece of the forest in order to create a path, and he swiftly extinguished the flames with his earthbending. Before he could get into the issue, however, he picked up another presence like he had done before with the wolf, and his face changed accordingly. Sokka deduced that Aang was connecting with the animals and plants of the forest, as they all sported similar expressions as he was making. Aang spotted a flutter bat, who had exactly the same pattern on his wings as he had on his face, and followed it down to a round pond. Aang felt a spiritual calmness surrounding the water, sensing a resemblance to the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole, and asked everyone to be respectful. However, Azula disregarded his request and fired a lightning bolt straight into the pool, believing that her mother was there. Soon after, the group was attacked by plants and vines, though the skirmish was cut short as Katara deduced the attackers to be waterbenders and forced them to reveal themselves.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Heeding the order, Rafa and Misu showed themselves and set up camp with the others, sharing a meal. Misu warned them that Forgetful Valley's ponds needed to remained undisturbed and retold the team her life's story. When Aang learned that they were on the lookout for a spirit with the ability to grant faces, he offered his help. He meditated, crossing over into the Spirit World, in an attempt to get the wolf spirit to come to the pool. After crossing over, he was aided by the spirit of the flutter bat he saw before, and hitching a ride on the animal's back, he was able to track down the wolf spirit. He tried to convince the spirit to come back with him to the pool where Misu and Rafa were waiting for him. The spirit took off, however, forcing Aang to follow him, holding on to his fur. The wolf took him to another pool, where the Mother of Faces chided him for having used her wolf as a beast of burden.[54]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang managed to successfully summon the Mother of Faces to the Spirit World, but she would only allow the group one request. Zuko said to Aang that Misu should be allowed to use this request to grant Rafa a new face. Aang apologized, saying they would keep looking for Ursa on their own. However, Azula interrupted Misu and instead requested information about Ursa, causing her to return to Hira'a to confront her mother, Zuko and Sokka chasing her. Aang said that they had to help, though Katara wondered if they should help Zuko and Sokka, or Misu, who was waterbending at the Mother of Faces to convince her to stay. After the ancient spirit chastised Misu for bending her sacred pool's water, the Avatar tried to convince the Mother of Faces that Misu meant no disrespect, but she re-submerged anyway. Aang dove into the pool, trying to pursue her while dodging spirit animals. Unable to find her, the young Avatar wondered how could the spirit be so cruel, and upon this, was ejected from the pool, Katara rushing to his aid. The Mother of Faces re-emerged, denouncing humans for having turned her into their slave and declaring her work \"inadequate\". Aang tried to tell her that they did not mean this, but the spirit continued her rant, scolding him for defiling her sacred pool and talking down to her as if she were a child, before calling all humans \"selfish, shortsighted, [and] insolent\". She told Aang and his group to leave, sending her spirit animals to attack them.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As Aang and Katara tried to defend their small group, the Avatar reminded his girlfriend to try not to hurt the spirits. He decided that, given the overwhelming quantity of attackers, it would be best for them to leave, though Misu refused, desiring what she and Rafa had come to the forest for in the first place. Seeing an aggressor nearby the two, Aang airbent at it, but in the process, Rafa's mask accidentally fell off, revealing that he did not have a face. Aang recognized Koh's handiwork, and upon hearing Aang mention that name, the Mother of Faces silenced her animals, asking the Avatar to repeat what he had said. Aang explained what he knew of Koh, to which the ancient spirit replied that he was her son. Aang awkwardly tried to take back his calling Koh ugly, though the Mother of Faces did not seem to mind, instead telling the group how he became estranged from her and how he stole faces to maintain a connection with her. Aang told the Mother of Faces that he had stolen the face of someone close to one of his past lives, yet he did not cause him harm. The Mother of Faces recognized Koh's handiwork on Rafa's face and restored it. Aang and Katara watched happily as Rafa and Misu embraced. Afterward, the Avatar thanked the spirit for her act of kindness, acknowledged that humans have been ungrateful in the past, though he noted that they needed to restore two relationships: between both brother and sister, and mother and son.\n" +
            "Aang and Katara made their way back to Hira'a with the Mother of Faces, who restored Ursa's former face and memories. Seeing that Azula had left and left the letter behind, Aang took this to be a sign of the princess changing, believing she had done this on purpose, to which Katara kissed him on the cheek for looking on the bright side of things. The Avatar reminisced on their mission, saying that they were successfully able to restore relationships between both brother and sister, and mother and son.[55]\n" +

To pass time, Aang took Kiyi out on sea to ride a wild flying dolphin fish. Their fun was cut short, however, when a frantic Ursa called out to him to bring back her daughter. As Aang quickly airbent them to the ship, he apologized to Ursa for having upset her though ensured her that Kiyi was never in any danger.\n" +
            "Some time later, Aang, Katara, and Sokka prepared to leave on Appa, noting that being back to the city will bring up many memories, which they need to figure out as a family.

He is recognizable by the distinctive scar on the left side of his face, which was given to him by his father, Fire Lord Ozai, shortly before his banishment as a result of an incident in which he unintentionally disrespected his father by speaking out of turn and refusing to duel him.[9]\n" +

As the infant lacked the \"spark in [his] eyes\" that is typical for most firebenders, the royal family was unsure if Zuko was a bender at all. Ozai, viewing a nonbender as firstborn as \"shame\", planned to cast his son over the palace walls. Only when Ursa and the Fire Sages intervened did the Fire Prince give his newborn son a chance.[16] Later on, it turned out that Zuko was a firebender, and peace returned to the young family.\n" +
            "Zuko rescuing turtle crab\n" +
            "Even as a three-year-old child, Zuko already displayed a strong morality, as he wanted to save both the eagle hawk and the turtle crab.\n" +
            "Zuko's family made frequent vacations to Ember Island in the following years, and Zuko would later consider this time the only one when his family was \"actually happy\".[17] When he was three, Zuko saw an eagle hawk attacking a turtle crab while playing at the beach. The little prince immediately rushed to rescue the crab, feeling the urge to help the weak. However, when he had the animal safely in his arms, Zuko realized that the hawk would die of hunger without its prey. Unsure which side he should take, the prince was eventually surprised by a wave and carried out into the ocean. Zuko almost drowned before he was saved by his father. The little prince spent the remainder of the day in the care of his mother, recovering from the experience while vomiting sea-water.[18] Zuko and his family also often watched the play Love amongst the Dragons at the Ember Island Theater. Afterward, the prince and Azula usually reenacted the final duel of the play at the beach. To his frustration, Zuko normally had to take the role of the Dark Water Spirit, the evil antagonist. Nevertheless, Zuko happily recalled these memories many years later.[16]\n" +
            "In his early youth, he was also schooled by Piandao in the art of fighting with dual broadswords.[19]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "However, as they got older, Zuko and Azula eventually grew apart and he became the object of his sister Azula's manipulation, ridicule, and deception. His mother, however, loved and favored him over his sister.[9] Especially Azula let her brother feel her increasing animosity, as apparent when Zuko, Ursa, and Azula walked in the royal garden around 94 AG. Zuko happily talked with his mother until the prince saw his sister burning a flower of the garden. He promptly told on her to their mother, as he thought that Azula's action was wrong. When Ursa scolded the princess due to this, she burned Zuko's bottom in retaliation. After sending Azula to her room, Zuko was consoled by his mother. Zuko tearfully lamented that he did not understand why Azula had \"to be so mean\", as he had just did what he thought was the right thing to do.[16]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Young Azula and Zuko\n" +
            "Zuko was completely devastated upon hearing his father say that he was \"lucky to be born\".\n" +
            "A few months later, Zuko and his family ate together at the palace dining hall. Azula soon began to brag about opposing their firebending teacher, Kunyo, calling his techniques \"the dumb way\" to firebend. After hearing this, Ozai agreed with Azula that the teacher seemed to be incapable and declared to send him to the colonies as punishment. When the princess expressed her satisfaction about this, Zuko objected. The young prince said that Kunyo was not \"a dummy\" and proceeded that the teacher just thought that good firebending has to begin with proper forms, but was promptly silenced by his father. Outraged about Zuko's behavior, Ozai scolded the boy about \"[daring] to lecture\" his sister on firebending. When his father angrily asked Zuko how many more firebending forms his sister had already mastered than him, the intimidated prince meekly answered that his sister had mastered fourteen more forms. Ozai continued to recount how he would have almost discarded Zuko because he thought that he was a nonbender when the prince was born. Finally, Ozai told Zuko that \"[Azula had been] born lucky\", while \"[he had been] lucky to be born,\" leaving his son completely devastated.[16]\n" +
            "Ursa's disappearance\n" +
            "When Zuko was eleven years old, his cousin, Lu Ten, was killed in battle. General Iroh, devastated by the loss of his only child, abandoned his 600 day siege of the Earth Kingdom capital city, Ba Sing Se. During an audience with Fire Lord Azulon, Ozai showed off Azula's prodigious firebending skill and knowledge of military strategy, both outstripping Zuko's. Azulon was unimpressed by these exercises and demanded Ursa and her children leave and Ozai be frank about his reasons for wanting the audience. Azula and Zuko eavesdropped on their conversation as Ozai voiced his desire to be made heir in Iroh's place, justifying this course of action by pointing out that Iroh's overwhelming grief and subsequent erratic behavior made the date of his return from war uncertain and he had no remaining heirs to carry on his line. Azulon, however, was outraged and declared angrily that Iroh had suffered enough, but Ozai's suffering had just begun.[9]\n" +
            "Ursa hugs Zuko\n" +
            "Ursa visited Zuko before her mysterious disappearance.\n" +
            "Frightened, Zuko ran away while Azula stayed to watch. Later, he was in his room trying to sleep when Azula came in and mockingly told him that Azulon's punishment for Ozai is that Ozai must kill Zuko, as he wanted him to know what it felt like to lose a first-born child. Ursa, hearing the commotion, came in and took Azula away, declaring it was time that they talked. Zuko, left behind, chanted quietly to himself, \"Azula always lies.\" Later, he was awakened again, but this time by his mother. She told her sleepy son that everything she had done, she had done to protect him, and instructed him not to forget who he was no matter how much things may change. The next morning, he immediately remembered what transpired the night before and ran frantically through the halls searching for his mother. He found Azula, who blithely told him Azulon died the previous night and their mother was missing. As she played with his pearl dagger (a gift from his Uncle Iroh), she mocked him and noted their mother was not there to make her give it back. Eventually, he found Ozai in the gardens of the palace and demanded to know where his mother was. Ozai did not answer and he hung his head in sorrow. At Azulon's funeral, the Fire Sage conducting the ceremony named Ozai the new Fire Lord upon Azulon's dying request.[9]\n" +
            "Banishment\n" +
            "Zuko begs\n" +
            "Zuko pleaded to his father for forgiveness.\n" +
            "Two years later, Iroh allowed a persistent, thirteen-year-old Zuko into a war council with Ozai and some of his generals. The young prince was instructed by his uncle not to speak during the meeting; however, when one general outlined a plan to sacrifice an entire division of new recruits in a diversionary maneuver, Zuko fiercely spoke out against the general's suggestion, seeing it as a betrayal of the recruits' patriotism. The insubordinate outburst was seen as a grave insult and Ozai demanded the prince participate in an Agni Kai. He agreed, unaware of the reality that it was his father and not the general whom he had insulted. Upon turning to face his opponent, Zuko surprisingly found himself against his father, he immediately became penitent and fell to his knees, refusing to fight and tearfully begging for his father's forgiveness. Ozai declared his refusal a sign of cowardice and another display of disrespect, affirming that \"[he] will learn respect, and suffering will be [his] teacher\".[20]\n" +
            "Ozai burned Zuko by permanently scarring the left side of his face, stripped him of his birthright, and exiled him from his beloved homeland, declaring that he could return only after having found and captured the Avatar, who had disappeared one hundred years prior. It was a fool's errand by all accounts, but one to which Zuko clung desperately as his only hope of regaining his honor and everything he had lost.[20]\n" +

            "Zuko and his uncle visited the Western Air Temple in search of the Avatar.\n" +
            "Zuko spent the next two years at sea,[21] fruitlessly and desperately searching for the Avatar. He searched the four air temples, beginning with the Western Air Temple, and scoured the world, searching even the most remote locations for his prize.[10] Iroh accompanied Zuko during his exile, and the pair spent more than two years at sea with a small ship and crew. They were not royal guards or special forces and may well have been banished themselves, or were foolishly intent on serving under the popular General Iroh. They were often unhappy under Zuko but obeyed his orders.[20] Iroh often considered the search an extended vacation.\n" +

            "After the Hundred Year War, Zuko was crowned Fire Lord and subsequently aided the Harmony Restoration Movement in order to move the colonials back to the Fire Nation. During the Earth King's official announcement of the plan to the people of Ba Sing Se, Zuko and his friends took a ride on Appa to watch the celebratory fireworks. While on the sky bison, the concerned Fire Lord asked the Avatar to make a promise: If Aang saw that Zuko was becoming like Ozai, as the Avatar, Aang would end Zuko's life. Initially disbelieving, Aang sought advice from Katara, who nodded in approval, and in seeing this, he hesitantly accepted.[12]\n" +
            "Furthermore, Zuko began to actively change the Fire Nation government; he removed most of Ozai's loyalists from their offices, making only a few exceptions, including Ukano. Because of this and his policy of reconciliation, some in the Fire Nation and the colonies developed a deep hatred for him. Underground rebel organizations were formed in attempts to restore Ozai back to power, and several attempts on his life took place, though ultimately, all these attempts failed.[12][22]\n" +

            "Fire Lord Zuko attacked Mayor Morishita after the latter called him a coward.\n" +
            "A year later, following five attempts on the Fire Lord's life, Kori, daughter of Morishita, Mayor of Yu Dao, broke into the Royal Palace to assassinate Zuko. Although she overcame the bodyguards, she was not able to defeat Zuko, who took her as a prisoner and learned the truth behind the attack. The Fire Lord traveled to her home colony to speak with the mayor; however, when Zuko explained that the movement was to bring peace to the world, Morishita reacted poorly and began arguing, using Ozai as an example of a Fire Lord who would not betray his people, causing Zuko to remember a visit he made to his father in prison. Ozai had warned him that he was going to return, as the young man would need help being the ruler of a nation that he could not handle on his own. The Fire Lord threatened Mayor Morishita, claiming that he was not like his father, and the mayor agreed: He was not like his father, who had many faults but was never a coward or a traitor. At this, Zuko ordered the mayor seized, but the guards were attacked by an earthbender, Mrs. Morishita, who asked the Fire Lord to forgive her husband for his statements. Zuko, surprised to see that she was an earthbender, as was her daughter, learned that the people had already been established in the city strongly enough to even form families between people from different nations. It was for this reason that Zuko allowed the Fire Nation colonials to remain in the city and announced his rejection of the Harmony Restoration Movement.[12]\n" +

            "Zuko subdued Katara in order to protect his soldiers from her fury.\n" +
            "After Team Avatar heard about Zuko's withdrawing of support for the Harmony Restoration Movement, they traveled to Yu Dao, where Zuko was staying. Aang and Katara flew over the city's walls to meet the Fire Lord; however, some Fire Nation guards informed them that no one could enter without the Fire Lord's permission, not even the Avatar, to which Aang claimed that he just wanted to talk to him. The guards responded by attacking Aang and Katara with firebending. After the pair defeated all the guards, Katara was grabbed by Zuko, who admonished her for attacking his people. Aang, angry at Zuko's action, warned him to let her go, but he insisted that she first had to agree to stop attacking; Aang separated Zuko and Katara with airbending, prompting Zuko to retaliate, and Aang to enter the Avatar State. Katara, telling him that he would not be able to control himself in an altered emotional state, managed to calm him down. The Fire Lord agreed to talk and gave the couple a tour of Yu Dao, pointing out how heavily integrated the lives of the citizens were in the colony. At this, Katara proposed a conversation with Kuei concerning the matter, to which the Avatar and Fire Lord both agreed.\n" +

            "Zuko asked his father for advice regarding the Harmony Restoration Movement.\n" +
            "Returning to the Capital City, Zuko met Mai, who tried to console him after noticing his tiredness and lack of sleep, and asked him to talk to her if he had problems, to which Zuko agreed and said it would not happen again. Mai informed him that she had brought the Kyoshi Warriors for better protection of the palace. That night, Zuko woke up in the middle of the night, convinced that he heard something. Going outside to investigate, he was informed by Suki and Ty Lee that it had been quiet all night. Confused, he went for a drink of water, hoping that the walk would do him some good, though ended up preparing tea to take to his father in prison. There, he knelt before him, and asked him for advice.[12]\n" +
            "Zuko kept struggling to find the right path and to overcome his insomnia. Turning to Ozai for guidance, he was told that no matter what he chose to do, it would always be the right thing for he was the Fire Lord and therefore whatever he said goes. Zuko refused to believe that, stating there was a greater good beyond his own decisions. Enraged over Zuko's beliefs, Ozai demanded him to leave his presence, as Zuko was still weak because of that.\n" +

            "Mai broke up with Zuko shortly after becoming aware of his meetings with Ozai.\n" +
            "While Zuko was pondering over what to do, Mai confronted him about his secret meetings with Ozai and blamed him for not confiding in her. He apologized to her and admitted that he loved her, but she retorted that it became apparent that he loved his secrets more than her and thus ended their relationship. Suki arrived immediately after Mai's departure, bowing before the Fire Lord while apologizing to him as she felt responsible for their breakup. She told him that she was the one who had informed Mai about his nightly talks in hopes of helping Zuko, as she and the Kyoshi Warriors were worried about him. However, when General Mak arrived to inform Zuko that Earth King Kuei was preparing to invade Yu Dao, Zuko pushed his relationship troubles aside and deployed his fleet to defend the colony from the Earth Kingdom Army.[18]\n" +

Ozai's voice echoed in his mind, telling him that the Fire Lord's will determined what was right. Convinced that he would never find the right path on his own, he offered himself freely to Aang. As the Avatar entered the Avatar State in order to fulfill his promise to Zuko, the Fire Lord noticed his mournful mother standing behind the spirit of Roku and asked her not to cry. Meanwhile, Aang unleashed an elemental attack on him, but before he could fulfill his promise to kill Zuko, both teenagers woke up with a shock.\n" +

            "Conflicted about his actions, Zuko sought advice by talking to a painting of his uncle, Iroh. His monologue was interrupted when a soldier alerted him that the fleet had arrived on Earth Kingdom shores, prompting Zuko to dress for battle and leave to lead his army.\n" +
            "The Fire Nation forces reached the gates of Yu Dao at the moment the Earth Kingdom forces were given the command to start the assault. Right before the battle ensued, Toph disabled all of the Fire Nation tanks by metalbending all their screws out. While the Fire Nation troops were in disarray, confused about what happened, General How ordered his Earth Kingdom troops to enter Yu Dao and arrest the colonials, a move Zuko countered by commanding his ground troops to defend the people of the Fire Nation in the colony, causing both armies to clash.\n" +

            "When How and his men were about to assault Kori, Sokka, and Sneers, Zuko came to their rescue, and commenced in a duel with the general. However, they were soon interrupted by Aang, who had entered the Avatar State. Convinced that Aang was going to fulfill his promise, Zuko shortly pleaded to reconsider, but immediately reconciled with the thought that his own demise was for the best. Zuko removed his helmet and watched as Aang displayed a strong feat of earthbending to create a chasm between Yu Dao and the fighting armies. However, as he was standing too close to the rim of the newly created abyss, the stone crumbled underneath Zuko's feet and he plummeted down, but in the nick of time, he was saved from death by Aang. Upon hearing the Avatar's reasoning with Earth King Kuei and realizing his own actions were right, Zuko collapsed.\n" +

            "Zuko awoke four days later at Iroh's Jasmine Dragon, where his uncle chided him for not visiting him any sooner. Aang joined Zuko at his table and together they discussed the future of Yu Dao, acknowledging that it could no longer be a Fire Nation colony or an Earth Kingdom town. They both also touched upon the dream they shared, causing Zuko to relieve Aang of his promise, as he realized that he could not put that burden on the Avatar's shoulders. He mentioned the sight of his mother in the dream and his desire to find her, believing that it would solve his problems by connecting himself to a part of his heritage that was not murky and confusing for him. However, every search attempt up to that moment to find his mother had turned out empty handed. Zuko realized that he needed more information about what happened the day Ursa left, though he knew Ozai would never help him. Determined to find his mother, he turned to the only person who he believed could help him coax the needed information out of Ozai: Azula.[23]\n" +
            "Searching for Ursa\n" +
            "Zuko thinks about family\n" +
            "Despite the appeasements of his friends, Zuko still wondered what his ruined family meant for his nation.\n" +
            "Some time after the battle for Yu Dao, Zuko attended a meeting together with his friends and several government officials at the home of the governor of Yu Dao to discuss the future of the city. A professor gave a lecture on ancient Earth Kingdom philosophies regarding the four nations, though it was of little interest to him, as he slowly zoned out as the man droned on. However, he snapped back to attention when the professor mentioned the word \"family\". Not having caught the entire statement, he requested the man to repeat what he had said, and he listened attentively to how there is a comparison to be made between how one treats one's family and how one rules. He pondered over the words, and when Aang asked if everything was all right, he wondered what the banishment of his mother for years along with his own actions of putting his father in jail and his sister in an institution meant for his nation.\n" +
            "Inspired by the professor's words, Zuko returned home and placed his father and sister in adjoining cells in order to facilitate conversation between the two in hopes of gaining information about Ursa's whereabouts. When he was told by Suki that Ozai and Azula had not said a word to each other, he entered the room to bring tea in an attempt to ease the tension. However, Azula perceived his attempt at friendliness as a way to mock the fact that she was restrained and subsequently knocked him over by grabbing the tray out of his hand with her teeth, much to Ozai's amusement. Zuko tried to prevent Ty Lee from chi blocking Azula, though he acted too late. He called the two Kyoshi Warriors back and gently positioned a now paralyzed Azula back into her chair. He explained to her that he just wanted to bring them a little dignity by giving them some tea. His sister sent him off, however, saying that the only way he could really bring them dignity was to let them have a conversation in private.\n" +

            "Azula burnt Ursa's letters, much to Zuko's shock and horror.\n" +
            "After half an hour, Zuko returned to collect Azula in order to wheel her to her old room in the palace, where she would be staying from that point on. Suki and Ty Lee accompanied him, though he sent them off in order to have a private conversation with his sister. Once alone, he asked what she and their father talked about, though Azula dodged the question and asked in return whether or not he had ever experienced the sensation of being chi blocked. When Zuko said he had not, she proceeded to meticulously describe the feeling, mentioning that one becomes extremely flexible right before regaining their full control. To prove her words, she twisted her arm out of her straitjacket and fired a lightning bolt at her brother. Zuko commanded her to stop, aiming a fire blast as her as she ran away, which ended up freeing her completely. Zuko was forced on the defense as Azula threw a blue fire blast at him, though saw how she made her way into an adjoining building. Zuko followed his sister into one of Ozai's secret chambers that was hidden by a firebending-triggered door, where she was rampaging about their father overcoming control to tell her the truth, while rummaging through a chest. Zuko demanded Azula hand him the letters Ursa had written that she had found; however, Azula burned them all in front of him â€“ save one, though Zuko did not know that. In order to receive the information, Zuko complied with Azula's request to allow her to accompany him unbound and with dignity on his quest to find their mother.\n" +
            "Zuko called on his friends to accompany them as well, though when they came to the palace and noticed Azula there, he had to explain to them how things had gone down and how she was going to accompany them to Hira'a, eventually winning his reluctant friends over for the idea.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Right before their departure the next day, Zuko put Katara's concerns about Azula's presence at ease by saying that his sister should be guarded at all times.

            "Some time later, nearing nightfall, Zuko forcefully had to hold Azula back once again, snapping her out of a psychotic episode. Upon nearing Hira'a, he commented that they should make camp as he did not want to enter Hira'a like a gang of bandits in the middle of the night. Zuko became distracted when Aang made a gruesome face, commenting that it was due to the presence of a spirit. However, when Zuko looked down, he could not see the wolf spirit Aang was referring to. Azula had used the commotion to stand on the rim of Appa's saddle and jump off, much to Zuko's shock since they were too high up for her to survive the fall. Due to Aang's intervention, Azula made it down safely and made a break for it, with Zuko on her trail.\n" +
            "He found her muttering to herself by a river, asking whom she was talking to. He reluctantly prepared to defend himself, however, when Azula made it clear that she no longer needed him, assuming a battle position. Their fight was cut short though due to Katara's intervention. At that moment, the wolf spirit of before appeared by the river as well, and Zuko noticed that the markings on its chest were the same as the gruesome face Aang was making. When the spirit became hostile and snapped at Aang, Zuko launched a fire attack at the creature, though was taken aback when it swallowed his fire and burped. After a brief scuffle with Appa, the spirit threw up a swarm of moth wasps that attacked the team. Azula asked Zuko to free her as she could help, which he dismissed stating that they did not need any help. However, when she pointed out that she could not possibly make things worse for them and stated that if he could not even trust his own family, than there was no one left for him to be trusted, he melted her icy restraints, freeing her so she could save them.\n" +

            "Zuko read a letter from his mother directed to Ikem, whom she stated to be Zuko's father.\n" +
            "At nightfall, the team had set up camp, and Zuko was sitting around the campfire together with Sokka, while Azula slept uneasily away from the group, Aang meditated, and Katara slept next to Appa with Momo. Answering Sokka's question, Zuko told him that he let Azula sleep with her hands unbound, as he was giving her a chance since she did save them all from the moth wasps. He also expressed his confidence that everything would turn out okay since Katara and Aang had agreed to guard her in shifts. When he asked why Sokka was still up, the Water Tribe warrior comically mentioned that he had bladder issues since he drank too much water to get rid of the moth wasps' taste, which was more than he needed to know. Zuko was surprised by Sokka's actions as the warrior commented about the cold weather and subsequently covered Katara with a blanket, leaving the Fire Lord wondering why he still cared so much about Katara after she had thrown so many snowballs in his face. Upon receiving the simple answer that Sokka did not mind getting the short end of the deal with his sister, Zuko was inspired to treat his own sister better and covered her with a warm blanket as well. However, as he went to return to his seat, he noticed a letter sticking out of her boot. He cautiously reached for it, being careful not to wake her, and read it, his shock growing with every word, as it was a letter written by his mother to Ikem, alluding that he might be his son as opposed to Ozai's.[24]\n" +
            "Zuko and Aang arguing about the letter\n" +
            "Zuko admitted to Aang that he actually felt hopeful about the possibility of not being Ozai's son by blood.\n" +
            "The next morning, Zuko discussed the letter's content with Aang privately near a cliff. While Aang was visibly shocked to learn of his friend's apparently illegitimate lineage, Zuko confessed that he felt hopeful and relieved over the supposed truth of not being Ozai's son by blood. He believed that his alleged illegitimacy led Ozai to banish and mistreat him as a young child.\n" +
            "When Aang questioned Zuko as to why Ozai did not just eliminate him immediately once he learned Zuko was not really his son, Zuko recounted how Ozai was going to kill him after being ordered by Fire Lord Azulon to do so as punishment for asking for Iroh's birthright of succession, though was somehow stopped by Ursa. Aang tried to dissuade Zuko from thinking and being relieved of his alleged illegitimate lineage, understanding the ramifications to Zuko's hold of the throne should the contents of the letter be revealed. Their discussion was interrupted by a psychotic Azula, who demanded to know where her letter was.\n" +

            "Zuko and Aang engaged Azula in a vicious firefight, but the Avatar became concerned over Katara and Sokka's well-being, so Zuko told him to go and check on them. He continued to hold Azula off, while the princess screamed at him to tell their mother that she was destined to become Fire Lord. Zuko attempted to break Azula's footing and gain the upper hand in their battle, but he was caught off-guard as his sister dodged his attack and hit him in the chest, thus knocking him off-balance. Azula received the opening she needed and snatched the letter from the pocket of Zuko's tunic. As she was about to give the final blow, Zuko grabbed his sister by her ankle while she was still airborne and flung her to the ground. He proceeded to dangle her over the cliff, asking why they always had to be fighting. He was answered with Azula's mutterings about their mother inducing Zuko to throw her over the cliff, when Azula realized that her brother did not burn the letter despite having it all night. Zuko stares at her sadly before letting her go, leading Azula to wonder if her brother actually wanted her to have the letter. Zuko replied that they should continue searching for their mother.\n" +
            "The siblings came to an understanding and went back to camp, where the others had just put out the fire made by Azula. They boarded Appa and flew to the direction of Hira'a. When they got there, Zuko suggested that they don disguises, and thus they were able to enter the town unnoticed, where they witnessed the final scene of Love amongst the Dragons. Zuko fondly reminded Azula of the times they would reenact the same part after watching the Ember Island Players, though Zuko wondered why he always had to play the part of the Dark Water Spirit.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After the play ended, they asked around about Ursa. The director of the acting company, Noren, invited them to his home to talk about Ursa privately, and Zuko gave thanks to him. At Noren's house, Kiyi, the director's daughter, asked Zuko and Azula if they would like to see her doll, to which he happily accepted, and he later chastised Azula for frightening the girl by threatening to cut off Kiyi's doll's head. Soon enough, they learned that Ursa was taken from town many years prior on official business, and Ikem, her broken-hearted boyfriend, left to Forgetful Valley to forget his past life.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang and Zuko talk\n" +
            "Aang talked to Zuko about the importance of the letter regarding Zuko's possible heritage.\n" +
            "Later on, Team Avatar bowed to the family in appreciation for their help, and they left. While walking back, Aang apologized to a quiet Zuko for reacting the way he did before, and suggested that they burn the letter, forgetting about finding Ikem, to which the young Fire Lord confessed that he did not have the letter anymore; he had let Azula keep it, and said that they should focus on the task at hand, and later take care of what he should do and be. Upon hearing this, Aang told Zuko to listen to him, and began explaining that when people come to the Fire Lord's throne, they did not bow down to him, but to the peaceful new era he represented, and therefore, no matter who his real father was, he should remain on the throne. Sokka interrupted their conversation to ask how much longer they would go on with the mission, as tensions between Katara and Azula were continuing to rise. Zuko declared that after going to Forgetful Valley, the search would come to an end.\n" +
            "Shortly after, the group arrived at Forgetful Valley, and Zuko halted Azula from burning everything around her to create a distinct path. After some more bickering, the group arrived at a pond of clear and quiet water. Zuko commented on how calm everything was, like a perfect pane of glass, and Aang told everyone that it was a spiritual place that needed to be respected. Zuko was forced to calm tensions once again after Azula saw her mother's reflection in the pond and subsequently disturbed its peacefulness by shooting lightning in it. Before the conflict could be settled, the group was attacked by vines and other plant life. After Aang freed Zuko from being pinned to a tree, Katara ended the fight, deducing that they were facing other waterbenders.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Azula attacks Misu and Rafa\n" +
            "Zuko placed himself in the path of Azula's lightning to save Rafa and Misu.\n" +
            "Rafa and Misu revealed themselves, and the two siblings set up a small camp together with Team Avatar to talk things out. As Misu told their life's story, how she had devoted her life to take care of her brother and how she would do anything to help her brother, Zuko and Azula looked away from each other. Aang wanted to help the siblings by going into the Spirit World, though that was not to Azula's liking who started to walk away. Zuko attempted to halt her, stating that Aang was the Avatar, and since he was all about helping people and they were his friend, helping people was what they would do, too. Azula responded by pointing out that she now understood that Zuko preferred to travel the world helping poor people as opposed to become Fire Lord. Zuko tried to answer and deny what his sister had said, but Azula entered into another of her episodes, claiming that her mother had sent the Water Tribe siblings to slow them down. When she angrily ran back, preparing to shoot a lightning bolt at Rafa and Misu, Zuko ran to their aid and put himself in between them and his sister's attack.[16]\n" +
            "Having successfully redirected his sister's attack, Zuko called on Katara and Sokka to take her down, but Aang had them stop after he was able to bring the Mother of Faces to the surface. She was willing to grant, however, only one request, and Zuko decided to give up his chance to learn his mother's fate from the ancient spirit so Misu could ask for a new face for her brother. Before she could finish, Azula interrupted, demanding information on Ursa. The spirit revealed that Ursa had a new identity as Noriko. Azula took off to confront her mother while Sokka and Zuko decided to give chase, taking a shortcut.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Zuko revealing the truth\n" +
            "After being convinced by Ikem to do so, Zuko revealed to Noriko that he is her son.\n" +
            "Upon arriving at Noren's house and seeing that Azula had not yet arrived, Zuko joined the family for dinner at the insistence of Kiyi and Noren. Focusing on Noriko, he asked if she was happy, and after she responded that she was, the Fire Lord got ready to leave, however, Noren stopped him. The actor convinced his guest to reveal who he was, which he did directly to Noriko. Noren explained that he recognized Zuko from his scar, and apologized for not telling him the truth about Ursa. After reminding Ursa about her past and alteration of both face and memory, Noren revealed to Zuko his true identity of Ikem. The firebender declared that Hira'a was where he belonged, with his \"mother, sister, and father\". Ikem was dumbstruck at the declaration, saying it was not possible. Before the conversation could continue, Azula burst through the roof, set on killing her mother. Zuko fought against his sister trying to stop her, only for her to pin Ursa to the wall. Zuko separated his sister from their mother, and they fought a moment longer. Azula wondered why Zuko continued to fight, knowing he wanted to be free of the burdens of the throne, and also wondered why he didn't throw both her and the letter off the cliff the other day. Zuko answered by saying the throne was his destiny, and that although his relationship with his sister was messy, Azula was still his sister. At this, Azula blasted an opening through a house wall and ran toward Forgetful Valley. Zuko tried to tell her to come back so he could help her, but she ran off and left the letter behind.\n" +
            "Ursa begins her tale\n" +
            "Zuko listened as Ursa began to recount the story of her life.\n" +
            "At that time, the Mother of Faces appeared, asking if Ursa wanted to regain her former life. Zuko tried to tell his mother that she did not have to, reminding her of the life she had made. Despite this, Ursa accepted the spirit's offer. The next day, Zuko and Ursa talked about their past, the latter apologizing for not loving them enough and for forgetting about him. Zuko insisted she did not have to, saying he had a life to be proud of, regardless. He handed Ursa the letter showing Ikem as his father, to which she replied that what she wrote on it was not true. Zuko was upset to learn that Ozai was indeed his father, but still felt like things were what they were meant to be. The Fire Lord said he wished to know everything about his mother's past, and Ursa told him she would start from the beginning.[25]\n" +
            "Zuko later delegated his Fire Lord duties to his uncle once more, sending him to Yu Dao instead to attend the announcement of the city's new coalition government, in order to be able to support Ursa and her family when they came to visit the Capital City for the first time since her banishment.[26]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Return to the Fire Nation Capital\n" +
            "Before escorting Ursa, Ikem, and Kiyi back to the Fire Nation Capital for the first time since Ursa's banishment, Zuko spent weeks searching the Forgotten Valley in hopes of tracking down his sister, though to no avail. While they were eventually under way to the capital, Zuko assured his mother that everything would be fine. However, he grew slightly embarrassed when she remarked that he always had that \"sparky look in his eyes\" whenever he was excited and waved it off, noting he was Fire Lord now. When Ursa grew distraught over Kiyi rejecting her, Zuko tried to comfort her, noting that everything was going to be all right, though failed to truly get through to his mother.\n" +
            "Some time later, Zuko noticed that Aang, Katara, and Sokka were preparing Appa to take off. Inquiring about their intentions, he was told that being back to the city would bring back many memories, which they needed to figure out as a family and bond over it. He agreed with the notion and thanked his friends for their help.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As they take off, Zuko noticed his mother stood by herself, tearful. Asking if she was all right, he was brushed off by a generic \"fine\". As she asked him if the others just left, Zuko apologized for not having come to get her to say goodbye, as he had not known she was still on deck. Noticing his mother's sad attitude, he inquires once again as to what is going on, though she merely brushed him off by saying she needed fresh air. Not letting it go, Zuko assured her that Kiyi would come around and figure out that Ursa is still the same inside despite having a different face. As Ursa admitted that she had actually been thinking about Azula, wondering if she was \"safe, warm, and happy\", Zuko said he searched the Forgetful Valley for weeks and came up empty-handed, which meant to him that Azula did not want to be found. He assured Ursa that Azula was safe, as she was a survivor, though confessed to not knowing what \"happy\" would mean for his sister. As he took his mother's hand, Zuko was startled by its coldness and promptly moved to take her below deck. However, they were intercepted by a messenger hawk from the Kyoshi Warriors. When asked if something was wrong, Zuko noted that it was nothing he could not handle and vowed to do anything in his power to keep everyone, specially Kiyi, safe.[27]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Later reign\n" +
            "Zuko's commitment to allow the older Fire Nation colonies to remain in the Earth Kingdom and regulate the balance of power between them, rather than to forcefully remove them, eventually led to the creation of the United Republic of Nations with Republic City as its capital.[28]\n" +
            "At some point in his life, he married and had a daughter named Izumi. In 134 AG, he also became a grandfather to Iroh, who grew up to serve as a general of the first division of the United Forces.[29] Zuko and Aang remained lifelong, best friends, with Aang regularly turning to Zuko for advice.[30] Zuko, in turn, would always trust the Avatar's instinct.[31] According to his grandson, Zuko also remained a good friend and important ally of the Southern Water Tribe.[32]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In 158 AG, Zuko joined forces with Southern chief Sokka, Tenzin, and Tonraq to deal with Zaheer, Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, four criminals who desired to kidnap the new Avatar, Korra. The group was able to defeat the four and send them to specially-constructed White Lotus prisons, which would serve to neutralize their bending abilities.[33] Zuko collaborated with Northern chief Unalaq and ordered the construction of a top-secret prison in the western tundra of the North Pole, specially designed to hold the firebender P'Li.[34]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Zuko continued to remain in power until 167 AG when he abdicated the throne of the Fire Nation to his daughter, Izumi, at which point he chose to leave the Fire Nation Capital in favor of living on Ember Island.[35] He retained his formal title of \"Lord Zuko\" and became an ambassador for world balance, albeit in an unofficial capacity, all the while making sure the new Avatar's safety was not compromised.[4]\n" +

            "Lord Zuko, alarmed about the escapes of Zaheer, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua, traveled north to warn Chiefs Desna and Eska of an imminent attack on P'Li's prison.\n" +
            "Two weeks after Harmonic Convergence, Zuko learned of the escape of the criminals Zaheer, Ming-Hua, and Ghazan from their custody under White Lotus sentries and was particularly disturbed to hear that Zaheer had become an airbender.[36] After sending a notice to Lin Beifong of their escape, he traveled to the Northern Water Tribe, where he and Chief Tonraq met with Desna and Eska, the new Northern chiefs. Zuko told them that they needed to check up on P'Li's prison in the western tundra. While riding the elevator to the bowels of the prison, Zuko explained that P'Li possessed the ability to create explosions with her mind and casually remarked that ironically he once sent an assassin with similar abilities to kill the Avatar, but that it did not work. Eska shared with Zuko her own experience trying to assassinate the Avatar after the latter spoiled her wedding.[34]\n" +
            "Zuko soon scouted the area around the prison atop his dragon, Druk, and only found what he thought to be a snowstorm. When he pointed this out to Tonraq, however, the Southern chief recognized it as Zaheer's doing. The two groups clashed, with Zuko finding himself matched against Ghazan. The old firebender was able to dodge his opponent's attacks for a short while, but was ultimately knocked down by a large fragment of rock. Zuko was only left to watch as the fugitives made a successful escape with P'Li in tow.[33]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sometime later, Zuko flew toward the Misty Palms Oasis on Druk with Tonraq in tow after the latter received word from Lin to meet her there. They awaited Korra's return in a local cantina, where he was pleased to make his reacquaintance with the Avatar. He learned that Zaheer and his friends were called the Red Lotus and that their murder of Earth Queen Hou-Ting was only the beginning of their actions.[37]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Upon Mako and Bolin's return to the Misty Palms Oasis, Zuko came out of the cantina, where he was greeted by a starstruck Bolin, who could barely form a coherent sentence. As Mako excused his brother and bowed respectfully, stating they were honored to meet him, Zuko returned the gesture.\n" +

            "Zuko and Korra\n" +
            "Zuko was glad to serve as Korra's advisor, just as he had done years ago for Aang.\n" +
            "Zuko followed Team Avatar toward Zaofu to use the Metal Clan's radio transmitter to reach the Northern Air Temple to warn Tenzin of the Red Lotus' approach. However, as the others prepared to head toward the temple, he prepared Druk to head back home toward the Fire Nation to protect Izumi in case Zaheer would target her next. Before he could leave, he was approached by Korra, who asked him for advice as Aang's best friend on what Aang would have done if Zaheer had given him the choice between giving himself up or letting a nation be attacked. Zuko answered that it had been Aang's dream to rebuild the Air Nation, though that he also knew that in times of turmoil, the world needed the Avatar the most. Zuko grew surprised when Korra thanked him for his advice, saying that Iroh had been right to go talk to him, as he had been unaware that she had met his late uncle. Before he could ask any more about Iroh, they were interrupted by Mako, who alerted them that they had finally been able to contact the Northern Air Temple, prompting Zuko and Korra to follow him toward Zaofu's communication's room.[30]\n" +
            "As the team departed for the temple, Zuko went home to his daughter, though two weeks later, he journeyed to Republic City, where he bowed respectfully to a recovering Korra. As she left, Zuko voiced his concern, along with President Raiko about the lack of information concerning the Red Lotus and their true numbers. He subsequently went inside the temple, where he attended Jinora's anointment as an airbending master now that she had received her tattoos.[38]\n" +

            "\n" +
            "During his exile, Zuko was a bitter, impatient, and complex young man, akin to a tragic villain. More than anything, he wanted his place as heir to the Fire Nation throne and his father's love.[41] Zuko believed, or forced himself to believe, that capturing the Avatar would make these wishes come true, making him one of Aang's most determined enemies. His motivation was focused on him redeeming himself which stood in contrast with other pursuers; Zhao and Azula were motivated by political ambition or cruelty.\n" +
            "Young Zuko speaks\n" +
            "As an adolescent, Zuko demonstrated empathy for others despite his pompous attitude.\n" +
            "Zuko believed one becomes strong by struggling and fighting for what they want. However, he expressed contradicting mindsets; he did not want good luck because he felt he could control his fate, but also believed he was marked unlucky and that the world was against him.[42] His reaction to the perception of the world always set against him is an iron-willed defiance and inflexible determination. He was clever, yet hot-headed, often letting his temper get the best of him. He seemed averse to the thought of harming others without any motive or benefit, having consented to Aang's request to spare the Southern Water Tribe in exchange for himself as his prisoner, and left the village unharmed.[43] He rarely thinks his situations through, causing him to get in trouble; he captured Aang at the North Pole, but chose to make his getaway through the perilous tundra,[42] and he casually took the Sunstone off its pedestal in the Sun Warriors' temple only to fall into a trap.[6] Said traits were criticized by his uncle,[44][45] urging Zuko to try to control himself and think things through more often, which he managed to do over time.[46]\n" +
            "Zuko had other contradictory traits, beliefs, and behaviors. He was domineering and controlling, a result of his upbringing as Fire Nation royalty, and disdained working with people he believed were inferior; yet he adamantly refused to view people as expendable. He believed it was wrong to sacrifice able-bodied and willing troops as a diversionary tactic. During his banishment, he displayed zeal in pursuing the Avatar, using whatever means he thought necessary. Although he had said capturing the Avatar was a greater concern to him than the safety of his crew or himself, he showed compassion to those close to him, choosing to rescue Iroh when he was captured[47] rather than pursue Aang, and risking his own life to save a member of his crew during a fierce storm. When the crew spotted Aang, he ordered the ship and crew to safety instead of chasing the Avatar.[20] Even after all the hardship he suffered at the hands of his sister, Azula, he was still willing to vouch for her, giving her several chances for them to work together in order to find their mother. He even went as far as to show brotherly affection for her, inspired by Sokka's actions toward Katara.[24] He was liable to commit brash actions against his sister, however, despite his best efforts to stop fighting her, even going as far as almost throwing her off a cliff.[16]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Zuko was able to show mercy, even to his enemies. When fighting an Agni Kai with Zhao, he decided to spare him unscathed, though Zhao had expressed every intention to hurt Zuko.[21] Even after Zhao had arranged for Zuko to be murdered, Zuko offered his hand in order to save Zhao's life when the Ocean Spirit was about to drown him.[42]\n" +

            "Zuko experienced substantial turmoil due to the events in his life.\n" +
            "The prospect of returning home and earning forgiveness was Zuko's sole motivation. After losing his first chance at the Northern Water Tribe, he was filled with abject despair. He found himself in the most dire situation possibleâ€”being hunted by his younger sister, the ruthless and relentless Azula,[48] while attempting to survive[49] as a penniless fugitive in the Earth Kingdom.[50] Apart from his ever-supportive uncle, Zuko had nothing. At first, he lashed out and turned to robbery,[51] even stealing from those who were kind to him.[49] After some time, however, partially in thanks to a talk from Iroh, he gained a more reasonable outlook. Theft was still necessary from time to time, but he refused to steal from needy people or people who showed him kindness. He defended an Earth Kingdom village against a group of thugs who terrorized its people.[9] He became more patient, kind, precise, and calculating; said traits necessary to evade Azula's pursuit while staying incognito from local authorities. He set Aang's pet bison and primary mode of transportation, Appa, free from Dai Li captivity at Iroh's suggestion.[44]\n" +
            "These traits became dominant after Zuko's fever dreams and hallucinations,[52] as afterward he displayed an optimistic attitude toward life and the world.[53] However, Azula successfully manipulated his desire for love and approval from his father, convincing him to betray Iroh and become her ally.[1] He continued to insist that he had truly changed, but felt conflicted about his choices afterward, uncomfortable with his betrayal of Iroh, a father figure to him.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Zuko at a loss\n" +
            "Upon realizing that Avatar Roku was his maternal great-grandfather, Zuko became increasingly insecure about his destiny.\n" +
            "After his return to the Fire Nation, Zuko thought he had everything he ever wanted: a position of honor, respect, and his father's love. However, he still felt angry and confused. His triumph was nothing like he imagined it would be. His temper went out of control; he became suspicious of Mai and got into fights with several people. Later, he stated he was angry with himself, saying he did not know right from wrong.[54] He received a letter telling him his great-grandfather's death would reveal his destiny. He found Sozin's last testament and learned of his history with Avatar Roku. Assuming the letter was sent by his uncle, he visited him in prison, demanding to know the message's meaning. Iroh explained Avatar Roku was his mother's grandfather, and Zuko's inner conflict was part of the legacy of his forefathers' conflict. Iroh presented him with the Crown Prince headpiece, an ancient royal artifact, traditionally worn by the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation and given to Roku by Sozin in their youth.[55]\n" +
            "Zuko became upset when he was not informed of a war meeting his sister was invited to, and showed happiness when a servant later came and asked him to head to the war room, as Ozai would not start the meeting without him. He told Mai he found himself unhappy, even when his father treated him as the perfect son. He said during the meeting, he had acted the perfect prince, the son his father had always wanted, but he was not being himself.[56]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "During the events of Day of Black Sun, Zuko realized it was his duty as the heir to the Fire Nation throne to restore peace to the world by joining the Avatar and fighting his father's (and forefathers') tyrannical regime. His zeal and resolve resurfaced in an entirely different direction. He resolved to confront his father and his many evils. He revealed in a discourse his banishment made him a firsthand witness to the misery and pain the Fire Nation has inflicted on the World. He discovered sharing the Fire Nation's greatness had nothing to do with the war â€“ only fired by a ruthless desire for power. He swore to his father he will do everything in his power to see his defeat. He attempted to free Iroh from prison, but when he escaped by himself, Zuko followed Aang and the others as they fled to the Western Air Temple.[41]\n" +

            "Happy Zuko\n" +
            "Zuko was finally at peace upon joining Team Avatar.\n" +
            "While at the Western Air Temple, Zuko showed a complete change in personality. After a flashback of his banishment, he was regretful about his former disrespect and ruthlessness. For the first time, he showed a comical side to his personality while practicing a speech to a badgerfrog. After questioning what Iroh and Azula would do, he tried impersonating them. He later admitted his wrongdoings to Team Avatar and apologized for the things he did. Out of resentment, his request to join them was initially rejected; he humbled himself and offered himself up as a prisonerâ€”a stark contrast to the proud young man shown at the beginning of the series.\n" +
            "Rather than trying to capture the Avatar for the Fire Nation's benefit, Zuko joined him to end their tyranny. He even defended him from the assassin he hired to kill the Avatar, signifying his genuine loyalty to the team. He realized his father could never restore his honor, and he had to restore it himself. He was happy when the Avatar finally accepted him as his firebending teacher and group member.[10] Though he still had some issues to work through, he was far more composed and receptive. Since coming to terms with his own true feelings, he was more laid-back and empathetic, though remained strict and uptight when training Aang. After joining the group he smiled a lot more than usual, even when jokes were made at his expense,[6] and he seemed very happy as Fire Lord during a break in his uncle's tea shop.[7] Nonetheless, he was one of the more serious members of the group; whenever a situation got worse, such as when Sozin's Comet was near and when Aang went missing, Zuko did not put up with any antics or mistakes.\n" +

            "Zuko rebuking his bodyguards\n" +
            "During his first year as Fire Lord Zuko temporarily became aggressive and conflicted due to night-terrors, chronic insomnia, and paranoia.\n" +
            "At the start of his reign as Fire Lord, Zuko was assertive of having the Fire Nation pay for its crimes and having its colonies disbanded. However, after viewing the situation at Yu Dao and how the lives of Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom citizens had deeply intertwined themselves, Zuko became conflicted about his duties, and after being called a coward by Mayor Morishita, he sided with his people, devoting himself to protecting them and their way of life, withdrawing his support of the Harmony Restoration Movement and even fighting his friends, Katara and Avatar Aang, because of this.\n" +
            "During this time, Zuko developed night-terrors, chronic insomnia, and a somewhat paranoid attitude. This would have increased further when he discovered that (at least some of) the assassins attempting to take his life were his own unhappy people, as he cared so much for his country. Zuko eventually became so desperate and conflicted over the duties and pressures of being Fire Lord that he turned to his imprisoned father Ozai for advice on how to deal with the pressures of the title.[12] Despite this, he continued to deny Ozai's claims that a Fire Lord's decisions were right by default. However, when being informed of the Earth Kingdom's impending attack, he begrudgingly admitted to himself that his father was right and prepared himself to go to war again.[18]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Eventually, Zuko came to realize that his emotional instability over his position as Fire Lord was not caused by the pressures of being a ruler or by the choices he made for Yu Dao, but due to his fear of ultimately becoming the same tyrant as his father was. However, he eventually came to terms with the fact that there was a side to himself and his personality that he could not understand.[23]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After an Earth Kingdom professor pointed out the similarities between governing a nation and taking care of a family, Zuko began doubting his own qualities as a leader again as his family was completely broken and a large part was due to his actions. However, he did show remorse and the will to fix past mistakes by trying to mend the rifts between his family. He freed Azula from the mental institution and asked for her help in his search for their mother, even allowing her to travel unbound and with dignity. After a conversation with Sokka about siblings, the latter noted how, despite their bickering, he and Katara were family and as an older brother, he would always look after her. Inspired by those words, Zuko, who never truly attempted to connect with his younger sister, Azula, tried to do the same.[24]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "During the search for his mother, and upon finding out that Ozai may not be his legitimate father, he realized that he might not be the true heir to the throne. Despite knowing that he must stay Fire Lord, Zuko felt the most hopeful and relieved in the group upon hearing the news. He believed that he could start anew and \"gallivant\" around the world helping people, as Azula remarked, much to Aang's dissatisfaction; he believed that Zuko must stay as the leader of his nation to continue ushering a new era of love and peace.[16]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When their search brought Zuko in contact with a young child, Kiyi, he displayed the characteristics of a good father, reflecting the parenting style of his mother and Uncle Iroh, by displaying an inquisitive and doting attitude toward the girl. When she showed him her doll, he kindly played along, and chastised Azula for her violent commentary, showing a protective and paternal side. He also seemed quite at ease around the child, showing genuine friendship and politeness during their interactions, seemingly truly enjoying the girl's company.[16]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In his old age, Zuko displayed a more calm and wise demeanor,[34] as well as a strong sense of protecting his family and the Avatar.[30]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Abilities\n" +
            "Firebending\n" +
            "Zuko firebending\n" +
            "Zuko developed a new foundation of firebending after visiting the Sun Warriors.\n" +
            "While growing up in the Fire Nation, Zuko showed no extraordinary skill in firebending. In his teen years, however, his ability began to develop significantly under his Uncle Iroh's tutelage, most noticeably during the last year of the Hundred Year War. He became able to fight on par with much more experienced firebenders, showing himself to be a late bloomer. Having continuously refined his skills, he has reached the point of becoming a firebending master, but despite his skill and fast development as a firebender, he has noted on more than one occasion that he is not as skilled or as powerful as his younger sister, Azula.\n" +
            "As a child, Zuko could only create small bursts of flame and was by no means focused or controlled in his bending,[9] but by the time he was thirteen, he was confident enough in his abilities to readily accept a challenge of Agni Kai against General Bujing.[20]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Around the time of Aang's discovery at the South Pole, Zuko was still learning the basics from Iroh yet was skilled enough to momentarily knock Aang off his ship, but he was defeated when Aang went into the Avatar State.[57] He utilized what he had been taught to defeat Zhao, an older and more experienced master firebender.[21] Throughout his pursuit of Aang, he demonstrated his skill often; he defeated multiple foes on two occasions.[47][58] Later, his skill grew. He fared well in a duel against Aang, delivering multiple fire blasts for a sustained period without tiring, but was defeated when he was paralyzed by June's confused shirshu.[59] He created a shield of fire to protect himself from a massive explosion on his ship.[60] During the Siege of the North, he fought Katara while the moon was nearly full. He held his own against her while she was strengthened by the moon, but needed the power of the sun to gain the upper hand and defeat her with one fire blast.[61] He also landed a decisive victory in a rematch against Zhao.[42]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After the Siege of the North, Zuko's firebending became more advanced and powerful. At first, he was unable to land any blows against Azula, and was defeated rather easily.[48] He fought somewhat better during the Confrontation at Tu Zin; in a three-way battle with Azula and Aang, he traded several fire blasts with his sister and kept the Avatar on the defensive.[62] As his travels in the Earth Kingdom continued, however, he learned more advanced firebending techniques from Iroh, such as lightning redirection, becoming more efficient and refined.[63] During a battle with the Rough Rhinos, he sent a small bolt of fire through Vachir's bow, breaking the string.[64] He demonstrated the ability to fire multiple small blasts through two fingers, rather than his whole fist.[65] During the battle in the Crystal Catacombs, he demonstrated how far his prowess had grown. His fire blasts were more powerful, and he charged his attacks before releasing them, creating enormous blasts of fire. He also demonstrated the ability to create two fire-whips. He battled evenly with Aang, even though he had skillfully used airbending and earthbending. After switching opponents with Azula, he battled evenly with Katara, a waterbending master who had the upper hand against Azula.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Zuko absorbing lightning\n" +
            "Zuko was able to absorb lightning from Ozai in order to redirect it.\n" +
            "Little was seen of Zuko's firebending after he returned to the Fire Nation; however, he was confident enough in his abilities that he offered to teach Aang. He utilized a wall of flame to stop an attack from Combustion Man, and was capable of dodging many of Toph's rocks which she hurled at him, though her earthbending was impeded due to Zuko accidentally burning her feet.[10] Later, he temporarily lost his firebending from a corresponding lack of rage, the former source of his power. In order to reconnect with the original source of firebending, he and Aang traveled to the ancient city of the Sun Warriors together. There, Zuko learned \"The Dancing Dragon\", an ancient firebending form that he performed alongside Aang. Learning this form appeared to have influenced his style of firebending to be more fluid, creating a more dancelike form as opposed to the rigid, militaristic forms commonly used by Fire Nation soldiers. He was also challenged by the Tribesmen to carry a piece of the Eternal Flame all the way up to the cave of the masters. Zuko and Aang performed their newly learned technique in unison with the dragons, who engulfed them in a spiral of multi-colored flames. After viewing this, Zuko found a new source of power in reverence for fire's power as a source of life and energy: \"the sun inside you\".[6] His stylistic differences and skill are demonstrated at the Boiling Rock where he briefly battled against Azula alongside Sokka. During the fight, he deflected many of Azula's fire blasts with only his arms or his own fire, and traded fire balls with her.[66] He later faced Azula again and dueled her evenly for several minutes. He fired several large and powerful fire blasts, deflecting many of her attacks.[67] Later, he attacked Aang with powerful fire blasts to make him fight back. When he chased him into Ozai's old family vacation home, Zuko created several lashes of fire to envelop his surroundings and augmented them to the shape of the hallway Aang was running through.[68] Furthermore, he used his firebending in conjunction with his broadswords,[9] demonstrated use of fire daggers,[48] and limited use of breath of fire.[61][69]\n" +
            "During his training with Iroh, Zuko attempted to learn how to create lightning. His inner turmoil, however, rendered him unable to achieve the required peace of mind, and his attempts to produce lightning would only explode in his face. Instead, Iroh taught him how to absorb and redirect lightning.[63] He later employed this technique against his father[41] and Azula to protect Katara.[46] In the latter engagement, Zuko redirected the blast in an improper stance, as he had jumped into the lightning's path, and so failed to redirect it completely and resulted in serious injury. Though he seems to have overcome his inner turmoil, he does not create lightning for the remainder of the series.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Zuko blocks attack\n" +
            "Zuko displayed the extent of his bending skills with the arrival of Sozin's Comet.\n" +
            "With the power of Sozin's Comet, Zuko's firebending was tremendously enhanced. He fought Azula one final time in an Agni Kai, unleashing extremely powerful sheets of flame. This time he held the upper hand, not showing any visible strain in exchanging and blocking Azula's attacks while she was pushed toward exhaustion and increasing mental instability. He displayed several incredibly powerful techniques: blocking an enormous stream of fire with a short fire-blast, spreading to take the shape of a wall and split the stream, unleashing an enormous charged-blast, which Azula was unable to block, forcing her to dodge, propelling himself into the air, charging his fire and sending down a fire attack as he came. His final attack was a fire tornado he created with his feet while spinning, knocking Azula off her feet.[46]\n" +
            "After the War and assuming the mantle of Fire Lord, Zuko's firebending remained as sharp as before and under strict control, despite the mental and emotional turmoils he was struggling with due to his new position. He evaded several attempts on his life, particularly the attempt of Kori Morishita, an earthbender and skilled weapons user, whom he disabled in a matter of minutes. During the battle for Yu Dao, Zuko's skills were again on display as he managed to single-handedly overwhelm a large number of Earth Kingdom soldiers with minimal effort and stand on equal footing against General How.[23] The flames he produced were also hot enough to instantly melt metal chains.[24]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "He handled Azula quite well during their fire fights throughout the search for their mother, blocking her fire blasts and defending his friends simultaneously, especially during her psychotic episodes.[16] This demonstrates how far he has come, being able to match Azula in certain terms of raw power, despite not being able to generate lightning or blue fire.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "During an ambush by the New Ozai Society, Zuko also demonstrated the ability to generate a fire vortex featuring green and purple flames, marking the first instance that a human has created dragon fire.[27]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "At the age of 88, Zuko still proved to be a capable fighter, although less agile.[33]\n" +

            "Swordsmanship\n" +
            "Zuko with his swords\n" +
            "Zuko is a highly proficient swordsman.\n" +
            "Aside from his bending, Zuko also developed masterful skill in swordsmanship, and he specialized in dual wielding swordplay, using a set of dao blades, skills he gained after being trained by the sword master Piandao.[19] He would use these skills as his primary tactics whenever he was in his Blue Spirit disguise,[51][70] unable to firebend, or when he needed to fight but also needed to conceal his firebending.[9] He was able to defeat multiple foes using only his swords, including experienced firebending soldiers.[70] He also dueled evenly with Jet and his dual hook swords until the fight was broken up by the Dai Li.[71] Zuko was able to defeat several Earth Kingdom soldiers with minimal effort by employing his swordsmanship skills in combination with unarmed combat and, in the same confrontation, demonstrated the ability to combine his sword skills with his firebending, allowing him to deliver more powerful and destructive attacks.[9] His skill was such that his father, Fire Lord Ozai, opted not to face him during an eclipse, when neither of them could firebend.[41] He also defeated Sokka, a very proficient swordsman in his own right and a fellow student of Piandao, with ease in multiple sparring matches.\n" +
            "He also had some experience with knives, being able to pierce a small object, like a horn, from a distance.[70]\n" +

            "Other skills\n" +
            "Blue Spirit sneaks\n" +
            "Disguised as the \"Blue Spirit\", Zuko made apparent the scope of his abilities without having to rely solely on his bending.\n" +
            "In addition to his firebending and swordsmanship skills, Zuko is highly skilled in unarmed combat, able to break apart oncoming spears with his hands and legs,[43] and disarm, subdue or defeat opponents. Zuko was able to defeat several armed Earth Kingdom soldiers in rapid succession. Zuko is very physically capable, able to almost nonchalantly send a person flying with a single hand and smash through iron shackles with a single kick. He is also quite fast and agile, able to perform great acrobatic feats, such as running across walls,[6] doing mid-air twirls, scaling vertical faces with great efficiency and climbing speed, and jumping large distances to avoid enemy attacks with noticeable agility and free-running skills.[10]\n" +
            "Zuko is stealthy and skilled in the art of infiltration, able to sneak into heavily-defended fortresses and conceal himself effectively for long periods of time.[61][67][70] His skills served him well while he was disguised as the Blue Spirit. Zuko is also a skilled tracker; he was able to track the airborne Avatar all across the world, something that his friends later acknowledged in their search for a missing Aang.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "While not as naturally adept at strategy and academics as his sister, Zuko is quite intelligent. Throughout his travels, he proved himself to be a skilled strategist, able to exploit any situation to his advantage. For example, Zuko used his ship's damages as a smokescreen to conceal his movements from Zhao.[72] He is also able to form alliances with people with special skills, such as June,[59] and use them to his advantage.[73] As he matured, Zuko developed greater strategic skills and foresight, planning ahead to avoid landing himself in compromising predicaments. When he and Aang needed to enter a specific room in the Sun Warrior ruins, Zuko was able to outsmart the celestial calendar by using his dual dao swords to reflect the sun's rays on the sunstone at the correct angle, activating the mechanism to open the doors.[6] He also displayed good military, organizational, and leadership skills when he became Fire Lord, which he demonstrated when he re-organized the Fire Nation Army into a more compact and effective force and later commanded it in the battle for Yu Dao.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As a leader, Zuko has also displayed charisma and good public speaking. His speech to redeem the name of the Fire Nation at his coronation was warmly embraced, not only by his own people, but by people of the other nations as well.[7] Despite a very tumultuous start, Zuko eventually came to be regarded as an excellent, benevolent Fire Lord, with his actions in helping create Republic City being recognized for many years.\n";

            "When the peace talks in Yu Dao came to an end, Aang and the rest of Team Avatar returned there to witness the introduction of the city's new coalition government. On his way to the subsequent celebration banquet, Aang spotted a woman dressed in a traditional Air Nomad attire and followed her. When they were alone, he discovered the mysterious figure to be Yangchen's spirit, though he could not hear her and subsequently did not understand what she was trying to tell him. Before he could figure it out, she vanished. Aang tried the remainder of the evening to contact her spirit through his meditation beads, but to no avail. When Katara came to get him to attend the Yu Dao celebration, reminding him that it too was something important, Aang was reminded of Yangchen's Festival, which would normally be celebrated the next day. He returned inside with Katara and alerted the three Air Acolytes, Xing Ying, Yee-Li, and Jingbo, as well as the other members of Team Avatar that they would go on a field trip the following day.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As such, the team left the next day on Appa, setting course to a cliff overlooking the ocean where the Air Nomads used to start their celebration of Yangchen's Festival. Excited about the prospect of reviving the Air Nomad culture, Aang enlightened his friends about what they were supposed to do during the festival, like bowing four times to the statue of a lady before walking to a sacred meadow where they would enjoy a traditional Air Nomad meal. Arriving, Aang admitted to Sokka that he actually had no clue about the identity of the woman who they would be bowing to, as he had never heard the complete story regarding the festival before due to always going kiting instead with Monk Gyatso. He shrugged off further inquiries as being of no importance, as bowing to the statue was just how it was done. However, unbeknownst to him, that reasoning reminded Toph of her childhood, due to which she refused to take part in the bowing ceremony. Aang tried to reason with her, though when she dissed the festival as being not important to the world, he let it go and used his own actions to impart a lesson onto the three Air Acolytes: a true Air Nomad lets insults pass them by in order to maintain their inner peace.\n" +
            "Polluted river\n" +
            "After the bowing ceremony, the group set out toward the meadow to enjoy their meal. Aang was appalled to learn, however, that a town with a large refinery had been built on the previously sacred grounds. Walking around through town, Aang spotted Yangchen's spirit once more and let it lead him to investigate together with Katara and the three Air Acolytes. He used his earthbending to help everyone over the refinery's fence, stating that they would not be trespassing as the fence was not supposed to be there. They discovered that the river running near the refinery was terribly polluted, causing Aang to conclude that the defiling of what was once sacred land was part of the reason why Yangchen had appeared to him. Before they could take any action, however, the refinery's guards appeared and tried to expel them from the factory's grounds. Aang used their appearance as another learning opportunity for the Air Acolytes by demonstrating how Air Nomads always try to avoid conflict unless absolutely necessary; he used his airbending to let the guards knock each other out.\n" +
            "Aang saving a man\n" +
            "Aang's actions had been witnessed by Satoru, the refinery's engineer and interim boss while his uncle was away on business, who heartily greeted him. Aang wanted to talk to him about the ground the refinery was built upon, though after Toph and Sokka returned from their outing into town, the entire group was invited to attend the grand tour of the factory, during which Aang's attempts to strike up a conversation turned out to be futile. During the tour, Aang spotted Yangchen's spirit once more and received a vision of a rampaging monster, leaving him wondering whether it was a vision of the past or the future. His determination to talk to Satoru strengthened by the vision, Aang was finally able to tell Satoru that the refinery should never have been built on sacred grounds and accused it of being the culprit of the river's pollution. When Satoru refuted the accusation and Toph backed him up, Aang took Toph aside for a moment. He was under the impression that the only reason why she believed Satoru was due to a crush she had on him. Their talk rapidly evolved in a heated argument, however, during which the ground suddenly began to shake, causing their friends to assume that they were the cause of that. When a second earthquake occurred, Satoru asked them all to leave, although Aang offered to help clean of the mess the quake had caused. Before they could heed the engineer's request, they heard a factory worker call out for help, as the quakes had left him trapped under a haywire machine. Aang and Toph instantly set out to free the man and managed to rescue him due to teamwork. Afterward, the two friends reconciled, coming to the conclusion that Aang was too focused on holding on to the past, while Toph tried too hard to run away from it. At that moment, Loban and his business partner, Lao Beifong returned to the refinery, shocking Team Avatar.[57] Aang was appalled to hear Lao dismiss Toph as being a confused young woman, rather than his daughter.[58]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Utor vs Aang\n" +
            "When Lao ordered the Rough Rhinos to escort Team Avatar off the refinery's premises, Aang took on a battle stance, declaring that he was not leaving until he had talked to someone about the refinery's location. As Toph created an earth slide, he used his airbending to blow the Rough Rhinos away from the factory's buildings and workers. Aang told the Air Acolytes to find cover while he locked in battle with Utor. Not recognizing him from their previous encounters with the Rough Rhinos, he made some small talk, getting to know the warrior, before incapacitating him with his earthbending by using his hands with earth to his weapon. As Toph catapulted another member of the Rhinos into the air, Aang gently helped him down, preventing any serious harm, though sunk the man into the ground after he assaulted him with a knife. Aang tried to talk to Toph, urging her to fight less aggressive, though he was told to stop addressing her as if she was one of his Air Acolytes.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After the fight, Aang was reminded by Xing Ying that they had traveled there to properly celebrate Yangchen's Festival, prompting Aang to lead them all back to town, where he searched for the old tree he and Gyatso used to sit under to eat their meal. Upon finding it cut down, Aang relocated to the restaurant that had been built on the same place. He was able to convince the cabbage merchant, who owned the restaurant, to allow them to eat their own food there, under the condition that they ordered at least one dish. With everything set up, Aang joined hands with the Air Acolytes and started to recite the blessing that preceded the ceremonial meal. Before he finished, however, he unintentionally crossed over to the Spirit World and was able to talk to Yangchen. She explained to him that when he had cut off his connection with Roku, he had also cut off his connection to all the Avatars before him. However, the ceremonial meal acted as a temporary conduit that allowed him to connect with his past life. Aang apologized for what happened with Roku, but stated that he could not just cling to the past like Roku wanted. Yangchen reminded him that his past lives were supposed to guide him, not bind him to a decision. She began telling him about her conflict with the General Old Iron spirit, though before she could finish and tell him of the details of the agreement she struck with the spirit, an earthquake in the physical world cut off Aang's connection to her.\n" +
            "Roused from his meditative state, Aang and the Acolytes hurried back to the refinery in order to help out. Upon witnessing all the wounded, he ordered the Acolytes to take care of them while he was briefed by Sokka as to what had occurred. Upon learning that Katara and several others were trapped underground, he began to bend a tunnel, though was urged to stop by Katara, lest he cause the entire mine to cave in even more, as the ground separating them was also riddled with iron ore that he was unable to bend.[58]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Having not seen Sokka nor Toph's students approaching, Aang returned to the spot of the cave-in, calling for Katara to \"hear the sound of [her] voice\" and to tell everyone to hold on. He also asked how well Toph was holding up and was told she was doing well given the circumstances. Upon the metalbenders' arrival, he confirmed Ho Tun's question about them needing to bend the iron ore away while Katara alerted him that Toph said the situation was like spider ants beneath stomping feet, only flipped. Hearing The Dark One say the scenario set his soul \"ablaze with ebon anxiousness\", the Avatar asked if that meant something to them; the other students told him it was an exercise where they were to stand in a sand pit while blindfolded and throw giant metal plates over their heads. If they failed, they would be stomped by the plates, causing Aang to opine that the academy sounded intense. He told the concerned Ho Tun that they could do it because their training prepared them for such an event. As the students proceeded, Ho Tun again grew worried that they could not do it because they were novices, but Aang pepped him up by saying that the three were the best metalbenders in the world outside of their sifu and thus the only ones who could complete the mission. He joined in for the last part of the task, keeping the dirt from collapsing back into the mine. With everyone out, the airbender ran to Katara, kissing her and expressing his happiness to have her out.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The skies soon turned stormy, and Aang realized this was unnatural. He saw Yangchen but was again unable to hear her, causing him to realize he needed to finish the meal. When Jingbo showed him that the vase was broken, Aang pondered what he could do and remembered Yangchen's words that the Avatars were linked like his meditation beads. The airbender made his way to a quiet spot and took a rock, bending it into a new fire pendant for his beads. After attaching it, he meditated and found himself before Roku once again. He started to apologize to his past life, but was cut off with the offering of a hug. During the embrace, Aang was advised that he needed to find balance not just between spirit and human, but also past and present, something that could help him in his current situation. Aang made his way down his recent past lives and found Yangchen, asking for the terms of her agreement with Old Iron. The old Avatar explained that she built a statue of Tienhai in return for him not taking up his armor, and that she decided to revert the meadow to its natural state as a sign that humans were still capable of preservation and protection; the Air Nomad festival was to celebrate this agreement. The young airbender asked if the iron the metalbenders found was Old Iron's armor, wondering if he could put it back and restore the town to its natural state to unbreak the promise. After being told only that his friends needed him, he returned to the real world. Flying on a tornado, Aang saw Old Iron rising from the water and returned to the town.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Upon return, Aang explained the situation at hand, which included destruction of all the buildings, including the refinery. He told Katara to help evacuate everyone, but soon noticed the iron mask they had dug up was gone. Seeing Satoru come by on a forklift and explain that Loban and the Rough Rhinos were dragging it to the beach, he only said they needed it back there. He waited in the town, watching the seas for Old Iron. When Katara returned, he asked if the townspeople were out of the buildings and was given an affirmative response. He asked her if she could see the spirit and stated his hope about him turning back if the town returned to its natural state. Katara told him he could not wait any longer and received a comforting kiss on the cheek from her, expressing his regret over having to destroy things. He asked if she would keep people away from the event and, after Katara's assurance, entered the Avatar State, creating an elemental sphere and rising into the air.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang flew to the refinery and began his attack, but it was blocked by Toph and her students. He came out of the state to ask why they were doing this before attempting to explain the dilemma surrounding them. He realized he did not have the time to do so and needed to finish his mission, needing to show that the humans knew how to preserve and protect. With Toph refusing to stand down, Aang had no choice but to attack, firing air rings at the four. He knocked down the students but Toph was able to block and counter with several rocks, dropping Aang to the ground in pain. He stopped one last attack before being faced with fragments of metal, though he dodged these. As he tried to talk, the students sighted Old Iron and called Aang and Toph's attention to the spirit.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang vs General Old Iron\n" +
            "The Avatar flew to Old Iron, trying to tell him about his role and that he knew all about the agreement between him and Yangchen, but the spirit did not listen and began to wage destruction. Aang responded by re-entering the Avatar State and his elemental sphere, gathering an equivalent body of earth while throwing punches at Old Iron and blocking return blows. When Toph and her students peeled Old Iron's armor away, Aang exited the state again, wondering what the four were doing. He was told to give the spirit an Avatar State-induced blow to the chest, but Aang initially refused because it could be too much for him to take. However, when Old Iron targeted the metalbenders, the airbender returned to the Avatar State and fired the charged blow to defend Toph. Soon realizing Old Iron had a large hole in his chest, Aang left the state once more. He tried to convince Old Iron that, as the Avatar, he could maintain balance between humans and spirits, but Old Iron only told him that it was merely a mantra to hide that the Avatar would always favor humans in any rift between them and the spirits. Aang wanted to prove that he could maintain balance, but Old Iron simply believed that humans wished only to dominate, telling him to look deep into his heart and see this as the truth, and thus balance was never possible. The Avatar sadly watched as the general paid him homage and disappeared into the sea. Standing on the beach, he was soon approached by Toph, who thanked him for saving her and her students. The two embraced as the sun reappeared in the skies.\n" +
            "Aang soon noticed that Tienhai's statue had been destroyed, saddening him. Approached by Katara, he mused if Old Iron was right about the spirits being only a relic of the past with no place in the present. Katara urged him to talk to his past lives; though Aang was hesitant at first since they were his past, he relented and began meditation again. However, he soon noticed several cranefish flying around him; he believed this was because the statue had been destroyed. He realized, however, that they were not normal birds, and an apparition of Lady Tienhai appeared from them. She told him her story about becoming mortal and, after her death, taking the form of the cranefish. Aang was not convinced regarding her opinion that humans were there to create as they failed in preserving her town, though was advised that they would always make a place for spirits while protecting what they grow. The Avatar was left wondering how she knew as she returned to her cranefish form and flew away.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Three months later, Aang was able to reform Yangchen's Festival into the Spirits' Friendship Festival, something that, while not entirely Air Nomad style was the same tradition, only in a new form.[59]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Spirit attacks in the Fire Nation\n" +
            "Aang intended to accompany Sokka and Katara, who were eager to return to their home in the South Pole after spending much of their days in the war. Right before they began their journey, however, Aang received a message from Zuko, summoning him to the Fire Nation to investigate some spirit attacks. Aang agreed to undertake the mission alone, letting Sokka and Katara travel back home.\n" +
            "Upon arrival at the capital, Aang was received with open arms. After the warm exchange of greetings, Mai immediately debriefed him on the Kemurikage, who had kidnapped her brother, Tom-Tom. Constable Sung added that dark spirit sightings were reported all over the capital city. When Ukano barged in on the meeting, claiming the Spirit World was acting up because the human world was weak, Aang interjected that the imbalance between worlds had nothing to do with strength, but Ukano ignored him and petitioned Zuko to enforce a curfew and form a special task force to hunt down the dark spirits. Aang opposed the idea, noting that enforcing a curfew would only create fear among the populace and that normal bending was useless against spirits. Instead, he insisted that they should work together to find out exactly what happened to Tom-Tom, with which Zuko agreed.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Zuko brought Aang, along with Mai and Kei Lo, to the Fire Sages Capital Temple, where the Avatar was happily reunited with Shyu, who had since been promoted to the rank of Great Sage. The group descended into the Dragonbone Catacombs, where they discovered murals depicting the history of the Fire Nation, though the murals preceding Sozin's reign were blocked off by a door bearing four dragon statues. Figuring that the statues worked the same as the ones in the temple on Crescent Island, Aang and Zuko attempted to firebend them. After twenty unsuccessful tries, Kei Lo decided to cut in, revealing that the locks to the dragons were actually in their noses, and unlocked the door using Mai's throwing knives.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Passing by paintings of past Fire Lords, they came upon a mural depicting the Kemurikage. Learning about a warlord named Toz, who abducted all the children in a village that refused to pay tribute. Aang, mortified by this injustice, wondered where his past life was when this occurred. As Mai concluded her reading of how the Kemurikage abducted the children in Toz's camp for revenge, a wisp of smoke appeared from the mural, which Aang decided to follow. Unlocking another dragon statue, Aang and Kei Lo ventured down the passageway while Zuko and Mai remained behind. The duo reached a crypt, where the smoke transformed into the image of a Kemurikage. The spirit explained that she and her sisters haunted the warlords of the Fire Islands until the first Fire Lord brought them to justice and unified the nation, at which point they departed the human world. When Aang asked why the Kemurikage had returned to haunt people, the spirit replied that her appearance was the first time a Kemurikage had roamed the human world since their departure.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "During their way back to the capital, Aang and Kei Lo informed Zuko and Mai of their discovery, causing Mai to suspect that Tom-Tom's kidnappers were impostors. Hearing chanting coming from the streets, the group investigated its source and learned that Ukano and Sung had formed a volunteer militia dubbed the Safe Nation Society, as a reaction to the Kemurikage abducting several more children. Aang voiced his disbelief as to how Ukano had managed to assemble a significant number of followers in one night. Upon being ignored, the airbender noted that the kidnappers were not spirits. Zuko dissolved the situation by ordering Ukano to disband his militia or face arrest and suspended Sung, an action that struck Aang as too severe.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Dropping Mai and Kei Lo off at her Aunt Mura's flower shop, Aang and Zuko returned to the royal palace. His night's rest was cut short, however, when Aang was alerted to smoke coming out of Kiyi's room. Along with Zuko, Suki, and Ty Lee, he discovered three masked intruders resembling the Kemurikage in the midst of abducting Kiyi. Aang attacked one with firebending before being kicked in the stomach, confirming that the kidnappers were indeed human. He subsequently instructed Ty Lee to try chi blocking them. The kidnappers' attempt to obscure their escape in a cloud of smoke was thwarted by Aang, as he cleared it up with his airbending. Although they managed to corner one of the kidnappers, the individual refused to answer their questions and responded by shooting lightning at them instead.[60]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Later life\n" +
            "After the Hundred Year War and the tensions of the Harmony Restoration Movement conflict, Aang managed to maintain peace. Together with Fire Lord Zuko and the rest of their friends, he transformed all the former Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations, where a metropolis named Republic City became its capital and the home to people from all nations. Aang also spearheaded the restoration of the four ancient air temples and constructed a fifth air temple near the heart of Republic City, called Air Temple Island where he housed a flock of surviving flying bison, along with a new type of winged lemur, the ring-tailed winged lemur, both he found some time after the war.[61][62]\n" +
            "Sometime during this period, Aang married Katara and they had three children: Bumi, a nonbender, Kya, a waterbender and Tenzin, an airbender.[63] When Tenzin turned five, Aang began to collect a series of stories and mementos from his life for his youngest son to read following his death.[64] Despite the peace the world was experiencing, family problems plagued the Avatar. Due to Aang's second responsibility of preserving Air Nomad culture, he spent more time and traveled more extensively with Tenzin, his only airbending child, so as to instill him with Air Nomad traditions. This made the elder siblings feel somewhat distant from their father.[65]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Yakone being arrested\n" +
            "In 128 AG, the city was suffering from a high rate of crime due to a notorious crime boss named Yakone. The fact that he was a master bloodbender, yet managed to stay out of the law's reach for a long time, caused Aang to find it necessary to assist the Chief of Police, Toph Beifong at the time, in his arrest in order to bring him to justice. Aang, Toph, and her metalbending officers apprehended the crime lord at Kwong's Cuisine. The criminal did not resist, and despite Aang saying that they knew that he was a bloodbender, Yakone claimed that he would beat the charges again. After attending his arrest, Aang was present at Yakone's trial, where Yakone was convicted of his crimes. However, before the sentence could be carried out, Yakone used his powers to subdue everyone in the courtroom, leaving them unconscious. Aang was capable of holding out longest, but he lost consciousness as well after Yakone used his skill to levitate the Avatar in the air and throw him against the stairs leading up to the court's platform.\n" +
            "Aang energybending Yakone\n" +
            "However, employing the Avatar State, Aang regained his senses, allowing him to pursue the criminal. He effectively halted Yakone's getaway by severing his mount from the carriage he was perched upon with an air swipe. Hovering around on an enhanced air scooter, Aang was subdued a second time by Yakone's bloodbending, who now fully intended to kill him. Entering the Avatar State, however, allowed Aang to break free of Yakone's grip, and he swiftly captured Yakone in an earth shell, before utilizing energybending to permanently remove his bending.[66]\n" +
            "The one hundred years Aang had spent frozen in an iceberg while in the Avatar State drained much of his inherent life energy, and by his later years the strain of this began to weigh heavily upon his body. When he felt that his end was nearing, he tasked the Order of the White Lotus to search for and watch over the next Avatar. Eventually, at the relatively young biological age of sixty-six, Aang passed away.[67] He was reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe as a headstrong, hot-headed, and rebellious girl named Korra.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Legacy\n" +
            "A massive statue of Avatar Aang was created on Aang Memorial Island, a small island located in Yue Bay. A teenage Aang is depicted wearing Air Nomad monk robes and holding a staff with the airbending symbol on top, overlooking the city he founded with the help of his friends. The statue was created and donated by the Fire Nation as a sign of peace and goodwill.[62]\n" +
            "As is tradition, a statue of Aang was also added to the inner sanctuary of the Southern Air Temple, in order to keep the line of statues of past Avatars up to date. His statue stood in the middle of the assemblage.[68]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Appearances in Avatar Korra's life\n" +
            "At age seventeen, Korra moved from the safety of the Southern Water Tribe compound to the bustling streets of Republic City. However, every time she found herself in serious trouble and was on the brink of slipping into unconsciousness, she would be plagued by visions of Aang's encounter with Yakone. Through these visions, it appeared Aang was attempting to warn Korra of the imminent threat that Yakone's son, Councilman Tarrlok, posed to her, though it was later revealed that he was actually trying to warn her about Amon.[66]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "However, it was not until Korra was at an extremely low point in life due to losing her bending that she inadvertently summoned Aang's spirit for the first time. During their talk, Aang explained that he was there because Korra had asked him to be, as she had finally connected with her spiritual self, due to being open to the greatest change by hitting her lowest point. Aided by all of the previous Avatars who appeared behind him, Aang compassionately used energybending to restore Korra's bending and passed on the knowledge of the art to her.[69]\n" +
            "After Korra lost her memory due to a spiritual infection, Aang appeared before her, taking over from Korra's own reflection and reminded his successor of her status as the Avatar, before making room for Roku to appear.[70]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "While Unalaq was attacking Raava, Korra envisioned Aang among the Avatar lineup she had seen prior to regaining her bending and his connection was the first to be lost.[71]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Appearance in Tenzin's life\n" +
            "When Tenzin was stuck in the Fog of Lost Souls, stricken with doubt over his potential inability to pave the way for future airbenders and live up to his father's legacy, a vision of Aang appeared before him. Tenzin apologized to his father and said that he would never be the man he was. The image of Aang agreed with this, much to the younger airbender's shock, and continued by saying Tenzin should never have tried to mimic him in the first place, and that he caused a false perception of himself. Aang finished by saying that Tenzin was not him, and that he should not be him, but be himself instead. His image transformed into an image of Tenzin and his son finally stepped out of his father's shadow.[71]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "Aang was fun-loving, somewhat naive, and adventurous with a sense of humor. He possessed a deep respect for life and freedom, refused to eat meat and was often reluctant to fight in his younger years.[7] He craved the stimulation of new people and places. His frequent off-course detours frustrated both allies and pursuers alike. He typically wished to forget his duties as the Avatar and would long for the normality that others possessed.[72] Yet Aang had always prided himself on a complex social network of friends extending over all four nations, and war did not stand in his way. In addition, he looked forward to playing with all the exotic fauna in each place he visited.[22] Whether it was otter penguins,[8] hopping llamas, hog monkeys, or giant koi fish,[72] no fit animal Aang saw went un-ridden.\n" +
            "Within this carefree exterior, however, Aang hid a great deal of guilt and a heavy mental burden in his duties as Avatar. As the reluctant hero, he wished he had been there to help his people a century earlier.[1] This initially caused him to conceal his true identity from friends,[22] and he still had a tendency to slack off in his studies of the bending arts, even though he naturally excelled at them.[1][73] He also tended to become distressed when he saw destruction caused by the Hundred Year War, believing that as the Avatar, it was his job to prevent such events from happening.[24] Eventually, Aang decided to stop dwelling on the past;[11] however, on several occasions, his desire to end the War caused him to take desperate action such as attempting to induce the Avatar State[28] or facing Fire Lord Ozai before he had fully mastered the elements.[47][74]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Being the last airbender and having no living peers, with the exception of the aged King Bumi and Guru Pathik, Aang developed strong bonds with his friends, particularly Katara, explained by Guru Pathik as a reincarnation of his love for his people.[75] His desire to protect them, however, led to violent emotional outbursts when they were threatened,[76] and he even resorted to deceiving and hurting others to keep the group together such as when he heard that Katara and Sokka might leave the group to visit their father; he hid the map to their father's whereabouts and lied about ever having it in the first place.[77]\n" +
            "Aang preferred not to use his bending skill in battle due to his peaceful nature. He preferred to solve problems non-violently. Even when forced into combat, Aang typically held back, fighting defensively and trying to subdue opponents without seriously hurting them,[22][77] even if they were not human.[33][35] This attitude was apparently common among all airbenders, who were all vegetarians and taught that all living things are precious. The only exception to Aang's pacifism was when his friends were threatened, in which case, he could become angry and attack his opponents, sometimes even entering the Avatar State.[28]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Events in the Earth Kingdom, however, began to take a toll on his carefree personality. Aang's attitude changed dramatically when Appa was captured. He became visibly enraged and hostile, particularly toward Toph, who had kept Appa company while they were gone. Despite attempts by Katara to calm Aang down, his anger continued to grow until finally he flew off to search for Appa alone. Eventually Aang returned to the group, but he was still visibly upset. He violated the principles of airbending when Momo was snatched by a buzzard wasp. He gave chase and rescued Momo, but unnecessarily struck it down with powerful airbending. After Aang returned with Momo, the group was confronted by the sandbenders who had taken Appa. When one of the sandbenders, Ghashiun, revealed that they had sold the bison, Aang lashed out and destroyed all their sand-sailers in a matter of moments using his airbending. He turned his sights on the sandbenders and entered the Avatar State upon hearing that Ghashiun had muzzled Appa. Aang's rage was only stopped when Katara grabbed hold of him and held him in an embrace until he finally calmed down and returned to his normal state.[76] Shortly after these events, Aang forsook all hope, choosing not to care at all in order to refrain from lashing out in anger and be hurt. The birth of the baby Hope lifted his spirits once again.[35]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After failing in Ba Sing Se,[40] Aang began to feel angry and upset with himself. He felt an urge to redeem himself and refused to let the others fight and be injured in the invasion due to \"his mistake\". Driven by a desire for redemption, he fled the ship on which the team was traveling, but the spirits of Yue and Roku allowed Aang to see that his mistakes were not his fault and encouraged to let others help him. He returned to his lighter attitude soon after.[43]\n" +
            "Four days before the invasion, Aang began to have nightmares about fighting against the Fire Lord. He started to unravel and chose to avoid experiencing them by not sleeping. This caused him to mentally fall apart even more, and he suffered intense hallucinations, blanking off into realistic daydreams. On the night before the invasion, his friends finally coaxed him to sleep, during which he defeated the Fire Lord in his dreams and regained his sense of fortitude.[78]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "During the invasion, Aang became extremely upset upon not being able to find Fire Lord Ozai, believing that he had lost his only chance to defeat him and end the war.[74] Aang expressed his determination to face Ozai anyway, even though at this time the eclipse had passed and Ozai was now capable of firebending once more. He was dissuaded, however, by Toph and Sokka, who advised him to retreat and attack at a more advantageous time.[47]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After the invasion, Aang was unwilling to face the reality of having to learn firebending, wanting instead to have some fun at the Western Air Temple; however, with the arrival of Zuko, he once again began training in earnest.[19][48] Although he had planned to wait until after the comet to face Ozai, upon learning of the Fire Lord's plan to burn through the Earth Kingdom, he decided to engage him anyway, even though he was not fully trained. He became extremely conflicted, however, upon learning that he would have no other choice than to take Ozai's life.[49]\n" +
            "Aang did show a somewhat flawed and stubborn side to his personality during the Harmony Restoration Movement. Like Roku, Aang was adamant on the idea that four separate nations would bring peace. This contradicted with Yu Dao, where citizens of two nations were able to live in harmony, make huge achievements, and have biracial families. However, Aang saw this as only another disaster that would lead to another war and persisted to move the Fire Nation colonials back to the Fire Nation, even if it meant separating them from their families. However, when Aang saw how intertwined the people from the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom had become and how his relationship with Katara was the same, he came to terms with the fact that his beliefs were outdated and realized that the world had changed significantly in the past hundred years. This prompted him to defend and support Yu Dao, found the Air Acolytes, and ultimately sever his spiritual connection with his dear friend, guide, and past life, Avatar Roku, who still completely refused and chastised Aang's choices. Later on, he and Zuko decided to form the United Republic of Nations as a compromise.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Although Aang retained his playful personality at times in his later years, as evidenced when he happily posed for a picture while spinning seaweed wraps between his hands,[79] he had also grown up to become more serious and decisive. He became annoyed when Toph referred to him by his childhood nickname \"Twinkle Toes\", disregarding the fact that he was forty years old. He also dealt with criminal lord and bloodbender Yakone in a way described by Tarrlok as \"head-on\", contrary to his previous attitudes of trying to find peaceful solutions and his aversion to fighting. Aang remained calm, level-headed, and soft-spoken in his later years.[66]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Abilities\n" +
            "As a reincarnation of the entity known as the Avatar, Aang possessed the power to bend all four elements, making him the most powerful bender of his time. Though Avatar Roku said mastering the elements could take many years, Aang was able to learn all four with considerable skill in a year, though technically he did not completely master all four as stated by Zuko and Toph.[49] As a result of his unconventional training, Aang never demonstrated most of the special subsets of the bending arts. However, he did display the abilities of lightning redirection and seismic sense, making him the first Avatar known to have learned these abilities. Most Avatars were not told of their status until they were sixteen years of age, but Aang had become a Fully Realized Avatar while he was still only biologically twelve years old. Thus, he became the youngest known Avatar to do so. As he was chronologically 112 years old, Aang also has the distinction of taking the longest to achieve this status.\n" +
            "Airbending\n" +
            "By the time of the Air Nomad Genocide, Aang was already an airbending master, the youngest in history at that time. Aang achieved his mastery tattoos when he mastered thirty-five of the thirty-six tiers of airbending and invented a new airbending technique, the \"air scooter\",[80] at only twelve years old. The element of air was the one he utilized the most in battle. Once Aang began to learn the other elements, for tactical purposes he relied less on airbending, though it continued to remain his signature element. As a master, Aang's skill with airbending was exceptional; he was able to fight on-par with strong and powerful masters[81] or against large numbers of opponents, despite not finishing his airbending training.[13] He was shown creating tornadoes[13] and currents of air strong enough to lift or deflect extremely heavy objects.[82] Aang's skill with air was great, even perilous, though his pacifistic Air Nomad nature halted the use of air as a deadly weapon, unless he was enraged[76] or in the Avatar State.[9] Instead, Aang used airbending for pure defense, evasion, or other round-about methods of combat other than aggression. When not in battle, Aang used airbending in his everyday life, often for flying with his glider,[83] or simply to augment his natural agility.[6] While in the Avatar State, Aang's airbending power was magnified to the point he could erode solid rock away with a powerful gust of air.[9]\n" +
            "Aang's airbending skills, especially his skill with the air scooter, greatly improved over time, evolving from being able to ride one to creating multiple air scooters simultaneously without any difficulty. At age forty, Aang was shown to have mastered the air scooter to a much greater degree. This version was superior in terms of size and duration when compared to the ones he showed as a child and was capable of being used as a high-speed method of transportation, as Aang quickly caught up with Yakone, despite the latter having had a good head-start. Aang was also capable of standing on the scooter, instead of sitting on it as he had done before.[66]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aside from his individual skill, Aang was also shown as a capable teacher, as he passed on the full extent of his airbending knowledge and techniques to his son Tenzin, who became a powerful master airbender in his own right.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Waterbending\n" +
            "Although Aang was originally better at waterbending than his fourteen-year-old friend Katara,[73] his lack of focus allowed Katara to surpass him as she was later deemed a waterbending master after rapidly developing her skills while training under Master Pakku. Katara became Aang's teacher when they took their leave of the North Pole.[27] In the early stages of his training, Aang showed prodigious skill in waterbending, being able to easily create a huge wave on his first try.[73] Although he had great skill with waterbending, it was one of his least used elements in battle, instead favoring other readily-available elements such as earth or air. He did not carry a water skin,[83] preferring to bend from large sources of water such as rivers, lakes, or oceans.[9] His control over the element was monumental, capable of creating massive tidal waves, albeit with the help of the Moon Spirit,[43] or bending entire streams of water. He was even able to extinguish a powerful, comet-enhanced blast of fire from Ozai and use the water to briefly put the Fire Lord on the defensive. While in the Avatar State, Aang could bend water from such remote distances a common waterbender could not reach, and he could raise the waters of an entire ocean, mimicking the moon pulling the tides, to cover an entire forest.[9] He was also capable of compressing massive volumes of water into smaller streams, a normally incomprehensible skill, allowing an increase in force and pressure and making it easier to transport.[9]\n" +
            "Earthbending\n" +
            "Because earthbending contrasted Aang's personality and his native element, air, he had great difficulty learning the bending art. Airbenders relied on indirect methods of combat, while earthbending required a head-on approach. When Aang was forced to protect Sokka from a saber-tooth moose lion, he stood his ground rather than avoiding conflict, showing an earthbender's attitude; he was able to earthbend soon thereafter.[33] His earthbending improved greatly, allowing him to utilize air, water, and earthbending in combat together effectively.[40] Earthbending even became Aang's second most used fighting style behind airbending, due to its general availability. Aang was capable of bending large boulders,[33] sending massive columns of rock flying, or forming earthen armor around his body for protection.[40] He also eventually learned to fight and bend blindfolded by detecting things through the use of seismic sense, a skill that he learned directly from Toph.[46] Due to his pacifistic nature, Aang employed a more defensive style of earthbending, based on manipulating the earth to create walls, shelters and restraints to neutralize his opponents, rather than harm them. While in the Avatar State, Aang could manipulate massive columns of rock, compress boulders into pebbles, or send rocks flying at high speeds in rapid succession, while requiring no physical connection with the ground to earthbend.[9] During the battle for Yu Dao, Aang managed to create a massive chasm around the entire city, effectively leaving it outside the reach of the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom armies. When fighting against General Old Iron, Aang created a gigantic stone body of almost equal durability to that of the spirit's iron armor.[59]\n" +
            "Despite the proficiency with which Aang used earthbending in his fight with Ozai, Toph stated that he could still improve.[49]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Firebending\n" +
            "While normally the Avatar must learn the four elements in the proper cycle, Aang was given the opportunity to learn firebending early from Master Jeong Jeong, instead of first mastering water and earth, in addition to his mastery of air. While training, Aang's impatience to learn the basics of firebending resulted in him harming Katara, an accident which caused him great shame. He swore from that point onward never to firebend again, out of fear of losing control.[81] It was not until after the invasion plan failed[47] that Aang sought to learn firebending again. After accepting Prince Zuko as his teacher[19] and discovering the true meaning of firebending from the dragons Ran and Shaw,[48] Aang no longer feared firebending and began his training in the bending art. He was shown to be quite skilled, yet initially reluctant to show the aggressive attitude required for firebending.[49] Aang was capable of performing the ancient Dancing Dragon form,[48] the breath of fire while simultaneously firing a stream from both hands, as well as highly powerful kicks and blasts able to incapacitate a Fire Nation airship, albeit with the help of Sozin's Comet.[84] In preparation for his face off with Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko taught Aang lightning redirection,[49] a highly advanced and unique technique of firebending that Zuko's paternal uncle Iroh invented by observing waterbenders.[33] While in the Avatar State, Aang could create exceedingly strong and highly destructive streams of fire, as well as melt solid stone.[9]\n" +
            "Energybending\n" +
            "After being endowed with the knowledge from a lion turtle, Aang was able to use an ancient form of bending that precedes all other bending called energybending, which he used to strip Ozai of his natural firebending abilities, leaving the Fire Lord permanently drained and in a weakened state.[9] According to the lion turtle, before the Avatar existed, people did not bend the four elements, but the life force energy within themselves. However, in order to bend another person's life force energy, the energybender's own life energy must be unbendable, or they could become corrupted or even destroyed.[7] It was confirmed that Aang was not the first Avatar to learn energybending; however, there were few who had learned this particular bending art and even fewer who had used it due to its dangers.[17] Energybending allows the bender to both strip and restore a person's bending abilities and transfer knowledge from one person to another.\n" +
            "At age forty, Aang's energybending skills had progressed, as he was able to strip Yakone's bending abilities almost immediately with minimal effort, unlike when he stripped Ozai's bending.[66] He also demonstrated the ability to restore a person's bending, as seen when his spirit appeared before Korra and restored her abilities that had been taken by Amon's bloodbending. At the same time, Aang imparted the knowledge of energybending and control of the Avatar State onto Korra.[69]\n" +

            "Other skills\n" +
            "Aang was extremely agile and quick even without bending, proven while forced to hide his bending when masquerading a Fire Nation student. He was able to defend himself without needing to resort to bending by simply dodging and avoiding attacks. This technique was first shown in Aang's fight against the student Hide in the Fire Nation school. Aang effortlessly defeated him without ever striking him, instead simply dodging his blows and pushing him when he was off-balance.[44] He repeated this feat at Yu Dao against a group of firebending soldiers, dodging and evading their fire blasts with a variety of acrobatic moves and without resorting to any of his bending arts and at the end only having his clothes slightly charred.[51] This fighting style was overall similar to the martial art Baguazhang, which consists of an intricate set of foot and palm movements to dodge, walk circles around the enemy, and strike unexpectedly as well as defend from all angles; this art emphasized the pursuit of harmony in conflict situations, rather than destroying or defeating the opponent â€“ all principles that Aang used often.\n" +
            "Aang could use his glider staff with great skill as well, using it as a method of transport and sometimes for attack, defense, or bending.[83]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aside from his combat skills, Aang also displayed an impressive degree of artistic talent on a few occasions. He was an extremely talented and agile dancer, being able to perform somersaults in mid-air among other acrobatic feats and coordinate with Katara in a dance. His somersaults at that time did not seem to be aided by airbending, as he was in a public area surrounded by Fire Nation students and there was no sign of any air currents around him. Aang also displayed a degree of musical talent, as he was able to play an airbender's flute well enough for the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club to revel in his performance.[51] He was also able to play the tsungi horn, although he was self-admittedly terrible at it.[44]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Avatar Spirit\n" +
            "As the Avatar, Aang was able to contact his past lives to seek advice and guidance. Being the immediate predecessor of Aang, Roku most often came to the young airbender's aid.[7][21] For example, it was Roku who warned Aang about the impending return of Sozin's Comet and manifested through the young Air Nomad in order to defeat a group of firebenders awaiting the Avatar's appearance.[25]\n" +
            "After receiving a letter from Guru Pathik,[39] Aang journeyed to the Eastern Air Temple to learn to control the Avatar State. Guru Pathik revealed that the secret laid in the unlocking of seven chakras. Aang had little trouble with the first six, but struggled with the seventh â€“ earthly attachments, mainly being Aang's attachment to Katara. Aang initially abandoned his training after receiving a vision of Katara in dire need of help,[75] but later began to open the seventh and final chakra successfully and entered the Avatar State. However, moments after entering the Avatar State, the process was interrupted when he was struck with lightning from behind by Azula, killing him and the Avatar Spirit itself, though after their escape, Katara was able to use the special water from the Spirit Oasis to revive him.[40]\n" +
            "Nonetheless, Aang's connection to his previous lives was severely damaged by this and, while in a coma, he undertook a journey to the Spirit World, where he met and reconnected with the four Avatars preceding him.[41] While he succeeded in healing the Avatar Spirit, his physical injuries prevented him from accessing the Avatar State and connecting with his past lives. As his body healed, he managed to reconnect with them,[7][21] though it was only when Ozai violently shoved him against a protruding rock, which unleashed the energy block in his back, that the connection was fully restored.[9] Later, however, feeling that Roku's advice about the state of the world was no longer relevant, Aang deliberately severed his connection to his past self. This caused an unintentional severing of his connection to all his past lives before Roku, except in certain situations, such as special rituals.[58] Later, Aang was able to restore his connection to Roku and all the past Avatars by recrafting the fire pendant on his meditation beads.[59]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Medium\n" +
            "As the carrier of the Avatar Spirit, Aang also had the capacity to act as a medium, a bridge between the mortal world and the Spirit World.[24][85] Even while still a young child, Aang demonstrated a natural affinity to the spiritual arts. Through meditation, Aang could separate from his body and travel to the Spirit World and, with the help of a spirit, his astral form could also visit the physical world's astral plane.[1][24] Once in the Spirit World, Aang could travel freely and communicate with beings such as Koh the Face Stealer.[1] This position as intermediary also allowed him to connect with other spirits while in the Avatar State; he combined with the Ocean Spirit to defeat the Fire Nation during the siege of the North Pole,[27] and had also channeled his past lives, namely Roku[25] and Kyoshi.[86]\n";
    public static String unaDesc = "Unalaq was a waterbending master, the chief of the Northern and Southern Water Tribes,[6] a former member of the Red Lotus, and the first and only Dark Avatar. He was the younger brother of Tonraq, husband of Malina, with whom he fathered Desna and Eska, and uncle of Avatar Korra. A particularly spiritual man, he briefly served as Korra's spiritual mentor until her discovery of his involvement in her father's banishment, at which point he was absolved as her teacher and shunned.[7] Unbeknownst to anyone, Unalaq was working to release Vaatu from incarceration in the Spirit World, and succeeded in this task before fusing with Vaatu to become the Dark Avatar. To this end, Unalaq nearly destroyed Republic City before being defeated and killed by his niece. Even though his attempt to destroy the Avatar and usher the world into an era of darkness was consequently thwarted, Unalaq succeeded in reuniting humans and spirits and thus changing the world forever.[3]\n" +

            "Unalaq was born to the chief of the Water Tribes, and he was the second in line to become chief after his brother Tonraq. Growing up, he dedicated his life to studying the spirits and their ways.[4] Eventually, he joined the Red Lotus, which had similar goals to his own. After learning about Raava and Vaatu, Unalaq concluded that Avatar Wan made a mistake by closing the spirit portals, believing humans and spirits should coexist in the same reality.[8] With a mind toward correcting this perceived imbalance, Unalaq aspired to usurp his brother's birthright and seize control of the spirit portals at the North and South Poles. To this end, he devised a plan to remove Tonraq from the succession so that Unalaq himself would be next in line to the throne.[7]\n" +
            "Young Unalaq\n" +
            "A younger Unalaq watched as his brother chased the barbarian horde out of the Northern Water Tribe capital city.\n" +
            "In 151 AG, Unalaq hired a band of barbarians to invade the Northern Water Tribe capital. Unalaq warned his brother, a general in the Northern military, of the threat, and watched Tonraq drive off the invaders. Tonraq pursued the barbarians to a forest sacred to the spirits, where Unalaq had told them to hide, knowing that the headstrong Tonraq would attack their encampment anyway, despite being on sacred ground. The forest was laid waste by Tonraq's forces and, in retaliation, vengeful spirits attacked the city, though Unalaq managed to calm them down and guide them back to their forest. Because Tonraq's recklessness had endangered the city, his father banished him from the North, thus making Unalaq next in line to become chief. At some point, Unalaq married a woman named Malina[5] and fathered a pair of twins named Desna and Eska.[9]\n" +
            "As leader of the Water Tribe, Unalaq gained territorial control over the closed spirit portals, which put him in a unique position to secure the entrances and carry out his eventual goal of releasing Vaatu and fusing with him to become a Dark Avatar and lead humans and spirits alike into a new era. However, the ambition he held of becoming the Dark Avatar was in direct conflict with the anarchist beliefs and goals of the Red Lotus, though it would not be until many years later that they learned of his plan to form an alliance with Vaatu.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When Unalaq discovered that his own niece, Korra, was the reincarnated Avatar, he believed that he could use her to help him open the spirit portals and traveled to the South under the pretext of requesting Tonraq's permission to train Korra spiritually, but his brother declined his offers.[4] After his attempts to persuade Tonraq failed, Unalaq devised a plan to kidnap her with the Red Lotus' help. He enlisted Zaheer, Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li to take part in the mission. However, on the day of the attempted kidnapping in 158 AG, Unalaq did not participate.[8] Instead, Unalaq betrayed the Red Lotus and cooperated with Fire Lord Zuko to construct a top-secret prison in the western tundra of the North Pole, specially designed to use the intense cold to negate P'Li's firebending abilities.[2] Unalaq would wait until Korra's powers matured before attempting to use her again.[9]\n" +

            "Becoming Korra's teacher\n" +
            "In 171 AG, Unalaq and his children arrived at the Southern Water Tribe for the Glacier Spirits Festival. They were greeted by many people, including Tonraq and his family. He greeted his niece heartily, though his manner hardened upon greeting Tonraq, prompting the same response from his brother.\n" +
            "Unalaq at Glacier Spirits Festival\n" +
            "Unalaq reminisced about the original traditions of the Glacier Spirits Festival while attending its modern rendition.\n" +
            "Immediately afterward, Unalaq took a walk with Korra, his brother, and Tenzin throughout the festival grounds, all the while commenting that the spirituality the South once had was dissolving. After Tonraq dismissed him, stating only some traditions changed and that it was not the end of the world, Unalaq countered by emphasizing that some traditions had purpose, as evidenced by the fact that ships in the South were being attacked by angry spirits due to this change. Surprised by Korra's unawareness of the situation, Unalaq offered to become her spiritual mentor, but was swiftly cut off by Tonraq, who declared Tenzin was all that Korra needed.\n" +
            "That evening, Unalaq attended a banquet thrown in his honor, though when Korra commented on how wonderful it was, the chief drifted off, reminiscing about how the current feast paled by far in comparison to how things used to be. He told his niece that when the festival was founded, it was a time for tribal chiefs to communicate with the spirits as they glowed and danced in the sky. When Korra admitted she had never seen that, he once again offered to become her spiritual mentor, but Tonraq again declined for her. Frustrated, Unalaq revealed that every Avatar before Korra had traveled the world to learn, but she was denied that opportunity by her father and Tenzin's decision to keep her secluded at the Southern Water Tribe compound.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Unalaq made a speech in which he declared that although he was honored to be able to speak to them all at the festival, he was saddened to see that the once highly spiritual event had evolved into a cheap carnival. He announced that the North could no longer stand by and watch the South slip further into spiritual decay. He hoped to change the course the Southern Water Tribe was taking, and as such, put a stop to the attacks of the spirits.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Unalaq calming a dark spirit\n" +
            "Unalaq employed a special waterbending technique and his vast knowledge of spirituality to calm down a rampaging dark spirit.\n" +
            "That night, a dark spirit attacked the area where Korra and several of her friends were sleeping. After Korra, Mako, Bolin, Tonraq, and Tenzin failed to defeat or calm the spirit, Unalaq interfered and performed a complex waterbending maneuver that instantly calmed the spirit down, basking it in golden light, and eventually caused the entity to disappear peacefully. He emphasized the importance of spirituality to the young Avatar, and offered to teach her again. When Tenzin stated that he planned to journey to all the air temples with Korra, Unalaq promptly dismissed the idea as useless, as he believed only he could provide Korra with the training she needed to become a complete Avatar. Korra realized the truth in his words, and accepted his offer.[10]\n" +
            "Opening the spirit portal\n" +
            "Unalaq and Tonraq\n" +
            "Unalaq opposed Tonraq's decision to accompany them on their trip to the South Pole.\n" +
            "Unalaq planned to start Korra's spiritual training at the spiritual center of the Southern Water Tribe, the South Pole. As they prepared to leave, Tonraq insisted on coming, since their travels would lead them directly into the Everstorm. Unalaq protested against his brother's offer, believing him to be a distraction. He stated that it was the nonspiritual attitude of men like Tonraq that had put the Spirit World out of balance, causing the spirits to attack. Tonraq defied Unalaq's protests, daring him to stop him in any way he could. However, before the conflict could evolve, it was defused by an arriving Bolin. Korra allowed her father to take part in Unalaq's journey, so long as he would not interfere with her training.\n" +
            "As they made their way toward the Everstorm and the South Pole, Unalaq explained to Korra that he intended for her to open a dormant spirit portal. He clarified that there was no such thing as an \"evil spirit\", just spirits that were out of balance, a balance that could be restored by opening the portal prior to the end of the winter solstice.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Unalaq outs Tonraq\n" +
            "Unalaq forced Tonraq to reveal his past to Korra.\n" +
            "Noticing they were being followed by dark spirits, the party sought out a cave where they would camp overnight. When he was asked why spirits were attacking sailors in the South Sea, Unalaq pinned the blame on his brother, forcing him to confess that he had destroyed a sacred spirit forest at the North Pole twenty years prior, bringing forth the wrath of the spirits.\n" +
            "When the group set off again, Unalaq overheard his brother attempting to convince Korra that he may have ulterior motives. He interjected, using the lack of southern lights to prove his claims. He explained that the Hundred Year War had thrown the South out of balance, and even though the Northern Water Tribe had helped the South rebuild physically, it had yet to be restored spiritually, which left the spirits to rampage in the Everstorm.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As they arrived at the place where the Everstorm raged, the group was ambushed by dark spirits. Yet again, everyone's efforts proved to be futile save for Unalaq's, who saved Korra from being devoured by an angry spirit with his spiritbending. After the attack, Unalaq overruled Tonraq's decision to go back, stating that they could not afford to lose another year to open the portal; it had to happen during the winter solstice that night. The arising conflict ended when Korra interfered and sent her father home.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Pleased Unalaq\n" +
            "A pleased Unalaq gazed upon the reappearance of the southern lights.\n" +
            "Upon reaching the frozen spirit forest in the heart of the South Pole, Unalaq instructed Korra to venture in alone and unlock the portal. He encouraged her to have faith in herself as he had confidence in her, and to let her past lives guide her through the dark.\n" +
            "As Korra reappeared after having opened the portal, Unalaq congratulated her upon having taken the first step to restore balance to the South, as well as the whole world. When the group returned to the Southern Water Tribe, they found the Northern Water Tribe naval force docking in the ports outside the city. Unalaq explained that opening the portal was just the first step to get the South back on the righteous path, and more work needed to be done before the two tribes were truly reunited again.[9]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Occupation of the South\n" +
            "As the Northern troops started occupying the South and setting up blockades, Unalaq told Korra that he planned for her to open the spirit portal at the North Pole. Though the Avatar reminded him that the solstice had ended, Unalaq reasoned that opening the Southern portal had strengthened her energies, which would enable her to accomplish her task. By opening both portals, both spirit and man could pass from one Water Tribe to the other at will.\n" +
            "Unalaq expressing his faith in Korra\n" +
            "Unalaq insisted that he had faith in Korra's potential to become a great Avatar.\n" +
            "Korra later visited Unalaq, explaining that many Southerners were opposed to the occupation and threatening civil war. Unalaq lamented that if that were to happen, the other nations would have to pick a side while the dark spirits fed off the energy of the conflict, resulting in a war between man and spirit. However, he told Korra that as the Avatar, she had to remain neutral and find a solution to this crisis. Korra started to agree with Tenzin's assessment that she was not ready to be the Avatar, but Unalaq insisted that he had faith in her potential.\n" +
            "As night fell, Korra returned to the palace to discover Unalaq being kidnapped by a group of Southerners. She was able to capture the Southerners and rescue her uncle. Unalaq ordered the rebels as well as their leader, Varrick, to be locked away, but Korra persuaded him to let the rebels stand trial first.\n" +

            "Unalaq testified at the trial in order to get his brother convicted.\n" +
            "The next morning, Unalaq arrived to arrest Tonraq and Senna for allegedly conspiring to assassinate him.[11] Promising Korra to give her parents a fair trial, he assigned a man he claimed to be most honorable judge of the Water Tribe, Hotah, to handle the trial. As the trial came to an end, Hotah found Senna innocent but sentenced Tonraq and the others to death. Unalaq, however, convinced Hotah to change the sentence to life imprisonment. Not approving of her innocent father being taken away, Korra later confronted Hotah, who revealed that the entire trial was a sham orchestrated by Unalaq to again remove Tonraq from the equation and keep Korra loyal to him. As Korra attempted to free her father, she was intercepted by Unalaq, who had sent his brother and the other prisoners on a ship bound for the north. Confronting Unalaq about his selfish and underhanded deeds, Korra renounced him as her teacher and demanded that he recall the prison ship and withdraw his forces, reminding him that he still needed her to open the Northern spirit portal. However, Unalaq confessed that he did not, revealing he had only exploited her into thinking that, causing the Avatar to attack him out of sheer anger and fury. After a brief struggle in which he was able to hold his own, he was eventually overpowered by his niece's airbending. As he was flung to the end of the corridor, Team Avatar rushed off to save Tonraq.[7]\n" +
            "Unalaq ordering Korra&#039;s capture\n" +
            "Unalaq ordered Desna and Eska to capture Korra, as only she could open the Northern spirit portal.\n" +
            "Later, Unalaq was informed by a commander of his troops that Tonraq and the rebels were camped out on a hill outside of the town. However, the Chief dismissed the potential threat his brother posed as being irrelevant, concerning himself mainly with the protection of the Southern spirit portal, requesting more troops to be sent that way. As the commander left, Desna and Eska entered Unalaq's chamber, and he instructed his children to find the Avatar, admitting that he had lied before about no longer requiring the Avatar's services, as he still needed her to open the Northern spirit portal. After Eska professed delight at chasing after Korra, Unalaq informed her that he needed Korra captured alive, to which Eska reluctantly agreed.[12]\n" +
            "Attempting to open the Northern spirit portal\n" +
            "Days later, Unalaq ventured into the Spirit World through the portal at the South Pole, and upon emerging, he found his children waiting for him. Remaining silent about what he had been doing in the Spirit World, he asked them about the Avatar's whereabouts. After the twins replied that they had Korra within their grasp, but lost her after she was attacked by a dark spirit, concluding her to have died, Unalaq chastised them for failing in their mission, despite Desna's claim that the dark spirits were out of control.[13]\n" +
            "Eska tends to Desna\n" +
            "Obsessed with opening the Northern spirit portal, Unalaq ignored the well-being of his son.\n" +
            "Later, as Unalaq's frustration continued to grow, he lashed out at his children for failing him, stating that it had been his mistake to trust them in the first place. However, believing there to be a way to open the Northern spirit portal from the inside, Unalaq needed his children to help him and led them into the Spirit World. As they traveled toward the closed portal, Unalaq informed his children that, by entering the Spirit World though the portal, they had retained their bending ability, and together with them, he hoped that their combined power would be enough to breach the portal. However, their assault resulted in a clash of energies, which struck Desna down. Completely focused on opening the portal, Unalaq ordered his daughter to leave her brother and to keep bending, stating Desna's need for a healer to be of secondary importance. Although his children left him, Unalaq did not give up and tried drilling through the spiritual barrier, although without success.\n" +
            "Unalaq traveled back to the Tree of Time in which Vaatu was trapped, and apologized for his failure, as he believed the Avatar to be dead and was unable to open the Northern portal without her. He was surprised when the spirit of darkness informed him that he had not yet failed, as Korra was still alive. When Unalaq announced that he would find his niece, Vaatu deemed the action unnecessary as she would find him soon.[14] Not long after that announcement, he was approached by Wan Shi Tong, whom he had previously befriended, and informed of Jinora's presence in the spirit library. Unalaq went with the owl spirit back to the library, where he confronted the young airbender. He expressed his disbelief that Tenzin would send his daughter with Korra into the Spirit World in place of himself, and told Jinora to not believe everything she read about Vaatu, forcefully taking her with him to the imprisoned spirit.\n" +

            "Unalaq threatened to destroy Jinora's soul in order to coerce Korra into opening the Northern spirit portal.\n" +
            "At the Tree of Time, Unalaq used Jinora to blackmail Korra into opening the Northern spirit portal; with his spiritbending, he threatened to destroy Jinora's soul if his niece would not cooperate. When Korra relented, Unalaq released Jinora and placed her in the care of a dark Furry-Foot, while they all followed Korra to the closed spirit portal.\n" +
            "After his niece had opened the remaining portal, Unalaq attacked her with waterbending. When Korra was subdued with the assistance of several guardian spirits, he began to perform his spiritbending upon his niece, encircling her with water with the intent of destroying her soul. As her body was almost entirely covered by a purple glow, Unalaq prepared to make his final move, but was thwarted when a large dragon bird spirit swatted him aside and took off with Korra.[15]\n" +

            "Desna and Eska later met their father at the encampment surrounding the Southern portal, asking the reason for their continued occupation. Unalaq stated that he anticipated that that Korra would come and attempt to close the portal. His prediction was soon proven right, as Team Avatar led an assault on the encampment, but everyone, excluding Bumi, was captured. Upon addressing his captives, Korra asked why he would help Vaatu when he would destroy everything. Unalaq refuted her claim, revealing that he intended to fuse with Vaatu to become the \"Dark\" Avatar, just as Avatar Wan did with Raava. Tonraq pleaded his brother to reconsider, reminding him that despite his connection with spirits, he was still just a man. Tonraq tried to discourage the Water Tribe chief from willingly throwing his humanity away, but Unalaq ignored him, stating that he would be fully aligned with his spiritual power upon merging with Vaatu.\n" +

            "Unalaq returned to the Spirit World, where he awaited Harmonic Convergence. However, Team Avatar managed to escape and followed him into the Spirit World. Mako and Bolin fought against Unalaq as Korra attempted to close the portal, but was too late. Harmonic Convergence began and the spiritual energies enabled Vaatu to break free of his prison.[1] From there Unalaq attempted to merge with Vaatu. However, Korra immediately attacked them both, managing to send Vaatu away from Unalaq before sending Unalaq himself out of the Spirit World through the Southern spirit portal and ordering Bolin and Mako to keep him out as long as possible as she engaged Vaatu.\n" +
            "Raava extraction\n" +
            "Dark Avatar Unalaq extracted Raava from Korra.\n" +
            "After Mako and Bolin exited the Spirit World, Unalaq began attacking the two with ice shards so he could get through. The two desperately defended the portal from Unalaq's vicious attacks. He stopped for a while in order retrieve assistance from his children, who defeated the brothers easily. Unalaq re-entered the Spirit World just in time to witness Korra attempt to lock Vaatu back in the Tree of Time. Unalaq immediately attacked her, stopping her from completing the process, thus allowing Vaatu to be freed once more. The two entered a brief battle that resulted in Korra being defeated. Mako and Bolin managed to recover and re-entered the Spirit World and, seeing Korra on the ground, attempted to help but were stopped and locked in ice by Desna and Eska. The four watched as Vaatu and Unalaq merged before touching the energy beam from the Northern spirit portal. The two permanently fused, becoming the first Dark Avatar. With Vaatu's essence, Unalaq subsequently battled against Korra, all the way back to the physical world, ultimately managing to rip Raava out of his niece. He proceeded to pummel Raava with waterbending, ultimately destroying her and severing Korra's connection with her past lives. Reveling his new power, the Dark Avatar subsequently transformed into a massive dark spirit and used the spirit lights to travel to Republic City and lay waste to it.[3]\n" +

            "Dark Avatar Unalaq was defeated by Korra's astral projection.\n" +
            "After Korra utilized the energy from the Tree of Time, her spirit transformed into a massive being of light, which departed into the material world to fight Unalaq. During the battle, Jinora's spirit manifested and released a blinding light, which entered his body and illuminated Raava's small presence within him. Korra's spirit subdued the Dark Avatar and ripped the light source out of his chest, recreating Raava. Korra's spirit subsequently spiritbent Unalaq and Vaatu, vanquishing both of them.[3]\n" +
            "Legacy\n" +
            "Despite his defeat, Unalaq's actions had changed the world forever. Severing Korra's connection to all her past lives was permanent, leaving the Avatar without the experiences, skills, and guidance the past lives had usually provided in crucial times before.[17] By luring Korra into opening the spirit portals and thereby causing Harmonic Convergence, he was also indirectly responsible for a shift in the world's energy that caused the reemergence of airbending and the rebirth of the Air Nation.[18]\n" +
            "While having been enemies, Korra was ultimately convinced that Unalaq had been right about Avatar Wan's closure of the spirit portals being a mistake. Therefore, she renounced the Avatar's role as a bridge between the two worlds and left the spirit portals open, enabling spirits to roam the mortal world and making Unalaq's dream of a world where spirits and humans coexisted a reality.[3] The Spirit Wilds the Dark Avatar created during his siege on Republic City changed the face of the city, since no one was able to remove them; despite initial conflict between the spirits and the citizens, the vines and the spirits became a tourist attraction by 174 AG.[19]\n" +

            "A hallucination of Unalaq appeared to Korra after she was poisoned, insisting that the time of the Avatar was over.\n" +
            "Unalaq's insistence on believing that the Avatar was no longer needed had a considerable impact on Korra. When she was administered a poison by the Red Lotus that would make her enter the Avatar State, Unalaq appeared to her in one of her hallucinations. Unalaq's face replaced that of Ghazan's and he told her that the time of the Avatar was over, urging her to give up and enter the Avatar State.[20] He later appeared to her again in a swamp-induced hallucination, in which Vaatu was extracting Raava out of her.[21]\n" +
            "Unalaq was later used by Varrick in his story of Bolin, Hero of the World, in which he was described as \"the diabolical but incredibly boring and unpopular sorcerer of from the North\". He teamed up with Amon, Vaatu, and Zaheer to take out their common nemesis, Bolin. He listened in on a conference call between the other three members of the team and made his presence known when Amon was about to say that he wished the chief to be excluded from their plans. He told his companions that Bolin could be found with \"all the beautiful ladies\". He sarcastically laughed away his partners' attempts to ditch him and tried to continue plotting their \"evil plan\" to take down Bolin, though was promptly hung up on by the others. Unalaq was said to be shot at by Juji's lasers, though they missed him and freed Vaatu instead. Described as always having been an \"annoyingly, clingy person\", Unalaq merged with the spirit and formed UnaVaatu. In their giant forms, UnaVaatu and Bolin were reported to fight on par and barrage each other with laser beams while stomping around Republic City. Although UnaVaatu nearly managed to corrupt Bolin's soul with spiritbending, he was defeated by the combined power of Bolin and the queen of the fairies and turned into magic dust to be scattered across the sky to give birth to the stars.[22]\n" +

            "Personality\n" +
            "Unalaq possessed an extremely strong connection with the spirits and the Spirit World itself. He was a firm believer in the traditions of the Water Tribe and a true fundamentalist when it came to honoring the spirits. Due to his connection with the Spirit World, he always believed himself to be better suited to rule both the Northern and Southern Water Tribes than his older brother; this ultimately made him self-righteous and callous in his approach, as evidenced when he removed his brother from succession, willingly putting the entire Northern Tribe in danger in the process. He also considered Avatar Wan to be foolish for sealing the spirit portals and separating humans from spirits, believing that the two groups should live side-by-side.\n" +
            "Beneath Unalaq's well-intended and benevolent demeanor was a treacherous and manipulative person who forsook compassion in order to realize his goals. His belief in the Avatar's failed duty, coupled with his own spiritual affinity, led him to fuse with Vaatu and take on the role of the Avatar himself, showing willingness to use any means to achieve his goals. This extended to betraying his comrades in the Red Lotus, his brother, and his niece, and even endangering his children. He proved himself to be an especially cunning and manipulative man, able to skillfully deceive people by lacing elements of truth into his lies.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "With his plans coming close to fruition, Unalaq abandoned his composure and adopted a more malicious demeanor. He started to outwardly take visible delight in the suffering of others, which he demonstrated when he gloated and smirked upon subduing both Jinora and Korra in the Spirit World.\n" +

            "Unalaq was a highly powerful waterbending master, being able to engage in combat using only a minimal amount of water.[7] When deprived of other sources of water, Unalaq was able to effectively utilize a water skin in battle. His move set ranged from strong torrents, water spouts, and unleashing multiple ice daggers in rapid succession. His water attacks were strong enough to shatter boulders and earth shields summoned by earthbenders.\n" +
            "Spiritbending\n" +
            "Unalaq could utilize a specialized form of healing infused with spiritual energy and knowledge, which involves converting the energy within spirits.[23] This ability allowed him to effectively calm angry spirits, to the extent where he was able to stop multiple dark spirits at once from destroying the Northern Water Tribe.[9] Conversely, he could utilize spiritbending to create imbalance inside a spirit, by channeling negative energy. When performed on a human spirit, Unalaq claimed that this technique had the potential to destroy the subject's soul.[15]\n" +
            "Dark Avatar\n" +
            "Unalaq becomes the Dark Avatar\n" +
            "Unalaq employed a dark version of the Avatar State.\n" +
            "After fusing with Vaatu, Unalaq became the Avatar's dark counterpart and the human embodiment of darkness, disorder and chaos. Because of this merger, Unalaq became significantly more powerful, being able to use his own version of the Avatar State, with orange-glowing eyes instead of white. Because of his deep spirituality, he took quick control of the Dark Avatar State, which helped him augment his waterbending and be on par with the Avatar, who had ten thousand years of experience bending all four elements. While in the Dark Avatar State, Unalaq was capable of unleashing much stronger water whips, creating ice fissures, and highly destructive tidal waves.\n" +
            "In addition to enhanced versions of his usual waterbending techniques, he displayed the ability to project Vaatu's tendrils from his mouth, which he used to extract Raava out of Korra.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After Unalaq destroyed Raava, he ascended into a new, giant humanoid version of Vaatu. He gained incredible size and strength in this new form, being capable of ripping out the statue of Aang Memorial Island with great ease and resisting the attacks of the United Forces fleet without struggle. He still had access to his waterbending, in addition to several of Vaatu's powers, such as his energy beam and vine control.[3]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Unalaq was a highly agile and capable fighter, able to hold his own against younger, athletic benders such as Mako and Bolin.\n" +
            "Unalaq was able to make use of his great knowledge of the Spirit World to gain an advantage over his foes. A notable example was using the spirit portal to cross worlds, thus retaining his physical body and consequently his bending in the Spirit World.[14] Thanks to his allegiance to Vaatu, he was granted control over dark spirits, which he used as his vanguard against his enemies\n";

            "Toph was born in 88 AG as the only child of the wealthy Beifong family from Gaoling. Born blind, she was sheltered by her parents, who believed her blindness made her fragile and incapable of looking after herself. They went to extreme measures to protect her, including hiding her existence from the rest of the world, which resulted in very few knowing that the Beifong family even had a daughter. Her parents expected their daughter to be well-mannered and proper due to their noble status in Earth Kingdom society, something with which Toph secretly disagreed, causing her to resent her parents' treatment.[1]\n" +
            "At the age of six, Toph ran away from home into a cave inhabited by badgermoles. Badgermoles were the first earthbenders and according to Toph, she and the creatures understood each other as they were both blind. She learned earthbending by imitating their movements.[9] In this way, she learned to \"see\" through the use of her earthbending, detecting people and other objects through their vibrations, which she sensed through the ground via her bare feet.[1] Her blindness and patience helped her to develop a keen sense of hearing.\n" +

            "Lao Beifong later hired the earthbender teacher, Master Yu, to instruct her. Acting upon the orders of Toph's father, he did not teach her anything other than beginner's moves, unaware that she had already achieved mastery in the art. She became such a formidable bender that she secretly entered underground earthbending tournaments as the Blind Bandit, and was successful to the point where she became the champion of Earth Rumble VI more than once. After meeting Aang, Toph soon ran away in order to teach him earthbending, but also to escape her parents, who never granted her any real freedom.[1]\n" +

He inquired her about her initiative to start the school, to which she answered that she had felt a \"calling\" to teach what she had discovered. However, Sokka did not believe this and realized the real reason was that she liked to tell people what to do. When they arrived at the academy, Toph caught her students leaving, but they excused themselves saying they had been kicked out. The earthbender proceeded to the academy and saw Kunyo and his firebending students, and ordered him to leave the place; the firebender refused, stating it was his school before the Harmony Restoration Movement. When they were about to fight for the academy's possession, Sokka interrupted them and proposed a \"match to the sit\" between their students in three days, which both instructors accepted.\n" +
            "Toph told Sokka how she had chosen her three students, but was unsure whether they could metalbend, so Sokka offered to help by being a \"motivational bender\". However, after two unsuccessful attempts to get the pupils to bend, Toph gave up and confessed to her friend her feeling of failure as she was trying to make her students something they were not; she stated her intention to surrender on the day of the battle. That day, at their opponent's arrival, she began sitting down but was interrupted by her \"lily livers\", who demonstrated they could metalbend and attacked the firebending team with metal coins, easily defeating them and making Kunyo sit down. Toph, happy at her students' victory, renewed her trust in them and continued with their training.[15]\n" +

However, instead of greeting the pair, Suki arrived in a Fire Nation war balloon, and explained that Kunyo had complained about a \"dirt girl\" and a \"snow savage\" taking over his school near Yu Dao. She continued to say that they were both needed to help her stop Zuko's army from going to war against the Earth King. Complying to the request, Toph left her students, telling them once again to practice their forms in her absence.\n" +
            "During the battle for Yu Dao, she earthbent an underground slide that led directly under Zuko's army. Emerging underneath the Fire Nation tanks, Sokka told Toph to metalbend the screws, effectively dismantling all of the invading tanks. When Suki and Toph found themselves outnumbered against several firebending soldiers, Toph's metalbending students arrived to save them.[16]\n" +

Afterward, she attended a banquet in celebration of the election with her friends, during which Katara inquired about the state of her metalbending academy; she answered without excitement that her school was doing well, to the point that she had more students than she could properly house. When Sokka suggested charging tuition in order to be able to finance the school's expansion, Toph promptly refused, stating that her school was doing something innovative and important, something from which she did not want to profit by developing it into a business.

Aang failed to enlighten the group to the reasons behind the festival, brushing off the inquiries to the identity of the woman depicted by the statue to which they would be bowing by stating that that was just how things were done, reminding Toph of her childhood during which her father had used exactly the same reasoning to justify every rule and action he imposed on her. For this reason, she subsequently refused when Aang asked everyone to bow, stating that she bowed to no one, and ended up denouncing the festival entirely as unimportant when he tried to convince her to participate regardless of a lack of detailed reasoning.\n" +

            "Toph became infatuated with Satoru and enthusiastically agreed to form a partnership with him and the Earthen Fire Refinery.\n" +
            "Toph's attitude toward the festival's celebrations did not improve during the next part of the ceremony, given that they were to walk toward a sacred meadow where they would eat a ceremonial, vegetarian meal. Along the way, the Air Acolytes and Aang created traditional Air Nomad music to accompany the group's walk, visibly irritating Toph to the point that she used her metalbending to destroy Yee-Li's cymbals. She tested Aang's nerves further by loudly announcing that she thought she had done away with the need for \"fuddy-duddy rituals\" when she left her father's house; it did not evolve to a conflict, however, as the group arrived at a town with a large refinery built on the meadow. Contrary to the others, Toph and Sokka were delighted to find the settlement and they promptly parted from their friends in order to find a decent meal of meat. They later reunited with the rest of the group on the grounds of the Earthen Fire Refinery, where the factory's interim boss, the engineer Satoru, became starstruck by Toph. She accepted his offer of a guided tour of the refinery, with her friends tagging along as her entourage. After being shown the factory's bender and mechanical production lines, Toph commended Satoru on his factory and in turn earned his praise when she managed to fix the motor of a forklift in mere moments through the use of metalbending. When he offered to sponsor a new school building for her and her metalbending students in exchange for their coming by the refinery on a regular basis to help out with the machines, she enthusiastically agreed to his offer by stating that she would love to be in a partnership with him, though immediately corrected herself by saying that she meant the refinery.\n" +
            "Toph and Lao\n" +
            "Toph met her father again for the first time in two years at the Earthen Fire Refinery.\n" +
            "Their conversation was cut short by Aang, however, who told Satoru that the refinery should never have been built on sacred grounds and accused it of being the culprit of the river's pollution. When Satoru refuted the accusation, Toph used her seismic sense lie-detecting abilities to corroborate the engineer's story and took his side in the argument, once again preferring the future over the objections of the past. She was subsequently pulled aside by Aang, who told her he was under the impression that the only reason why she believed Satoru was due to a crush she had on him; Toph countered by rhetorically asking him whether this impressionability was similar to having a skewed perception due to a nostalgic affinity to cultural rituals. Pointing to the refinery, she continued by saying that it employed the same ethic as the one they desired in Yu Dao: a place where people worked and lived in harmony, regardless of where they came from. She ended her reasoning by asking him if he really wanted to sacrifice what she and Satoru deemed to be the future for a \"stupid, backwards holiday\". Aang took the insult personally and their talk rapidly evolved in a heated argument. The verbal fight was cut short, however, when the ground suddenly began to shake, causing Katara and Sokka to run up to them to ask them to remain calm; when Aang deftly deflected the accusation, Toph took offense at his implication of her being a novice earthbender who could not control her bending. While she complained about this, however, a second, even more powerful quake occurred, causing Satoru to ask them all to leave, increasing Toph's annoyance. Before they could heed the engineer's request, they heard a factory worker cry out for help, as the quakes had left him trapped under a haywire machine. Toph and Aang instantly set out to free the man, and managed to rescue him due to teamwork. With the crisis averted, Toph easily accepted Aang's apology and apologized as well, though asked him if he was not trying too hard to hold onto his past. He conceded that perhaps he was, but retorted by asking if she was not trying too hard to escape hers, to which Toph replied that some people simply had to run away in order to live. The conversation was cut short by the arrival of the two owners of the refinery, bringing Toph face-to-face with her father, Lao Beifong, for the first time in two years.[18]\n" +

            "Toph was shocked to hear her father say that she was a confused young lady, rather than his daughter and she grew angry upon hearing him command the Rough Rhinos to escort her and her friends off the refinery's premises. She refused to leave until she had spoken to her father, leading to a violent confrontation with the Rough Rhinos. She used an earth pillar to catapult one of the members into the air after he had nearly sliced her with his chain blades. Her action, however, earned her a reprimanding speech from Aang, much to her annoyance. She told him to stop talking to her like she was one of his Air Acolyte children and left to continue fighting her way. She encountered Ogodei, who had successfully captured all the Acolytes, and used her metalbending to chain him down with his own weapon. When she learned that the Acolytes did not fully defend themselves because they were following the precepts of Air Nomad philosophy, she got mad and told them to care more about the present than the past, lest they would have no present to care about anymore.\n" +
            "Lao and Toph\n" +
            "In an attempt to reconcile with her father, Toph came to talk to him.\n" +
            "Toph left to go find her father, breaking down a factory wall to gain access to the refinery's grounds. She was pointed in the direction of her father's office by Satoru, who quickly joined her to guide her to him himself. When he offered his help, however, Toph coldly asked if he was sure he wanted to do that, mocking his earlier respectful action toward Loban to have been groveling. Entering her father's office, Toph was once again told by him that he was not his daughter, as he had raised a poised, demure, obedient young woman. Toph acknowledged that she had put her family through a lot, but she tried to get her father to realize who she really was and revealed that she had just been acting to be a quiet little girl in order to please them. She was hurt when her father did not react to any of her accomplishments, concluding that talking to him had been a mistake and that she would never bother him again.\n" +

            "When Sokka barged in and told Lao to follow him down toward the iron mine, Toph accompanied them. Upon learning that Loban excavated an unstable iron ore deposit site, she chastised him for it, telling him that he needed to start caring more about people's lives as opposed to just money. When Satoru came to his uncle's defense, Toph told him to trust her that she was right, as she could feel the earth and ore shifting around them, making the mine a dangerous place to work in. As the mine subsequently collapsed after Kahchi accidentally broke one of the support beams, Toph used her metalbending to keep all the trapped people from getting crushed by the debris.[19]\n" +
            "Lao Beifong apologizes\n" +
            "Confronted with the possibility of death, Lao finally apologized to Toph for his past mistakes.\n" +
            "While continuing to support the weight of the ore as best as she could, Toph was given the water in Katara's water skin by Satoru. After finishing the drink, she asked Satoru to stay and talk to her, assuring him it would not be a distraction. She learned that the scientist had run away from home and, after hearing his story, said he was not a \"sniveling flunky\" as he claimed for not confronting his uncle. Lao interrupted to talk to Toph himself about what had happened in the time between her disappearance and the present. Knowing it may have been their final moments, he tried to make amends, saying he had always thought about her, bringing tears to the young earthbender's eyes. She soon responded by saying that if he really knew her, there would be no doubt as to whether they would survive because she was the greatest earthbender of all time. After her students freed them, she made an out of breath remark that their work was not bad, but soon passed out, falling into the arms of her father.[20]\n" +

            "After waking up and seeing Lao and a refinery worker in panic, Toph asked what was happening. She rejected his advice to lay down and stay safe, demanding to know the situation. She grew shocked when her father told her that Aang intended to destroy the Earthen Fire Refinery for no apparent reason. After being told it would not only ruin him but eradicate a symbol of international peace, Toph vowed to stop him, calling on her students to join her. The group blocked Aang's initial strike, telling him they were there to stop him. She refused to stand by and let him destroy what the people had built. The foursome was attacked by air rings, though Toph was able to dodge the one targeted for her with an earthen wall, which she used to launch several attacks at the Avatar. She soon changed the attack method to metalbending, asking Aang if he realized how ridiculous the situation was. They were soon cut off when her students called their attention to the spirit General Old Iron approaching the town.\n" +
            "Team Beifong vs Old Iron\n" +
            "Noticing Aang's inability to pierce Old Iron's armor, Toph risked her own life to help him by metalbending it off.\n" +
            "As Aang tried to fight off Old Iron, Toph again called on her students, this time to help the Avatar. They realized that they needed to peel off the spirit's iron armor to give Aang any chance, which was like the exercise of \"Forest Bowing to the East Wind\". The four quickly removed the armor, prompting the earthbender to tell Aang to give Old Iron an Avatar State-induced blow to the chest. When Old Iron realized the metalbenders were responsible for the removal of his armor and targeted them, Toph told her students to run while she would hold him off. After Aang defeated Old Iron and the spirit vanished below the sea, Toph went to him at the shore, remarking that it could not have been easy for him to battle the spirit. She thanked him for saving her and her students and the two embraced as the sun emerged from behind the clouds.\n" +
            "Afterward, Toph heard her father giving his workers a motivational speech, remarking that while it was not as good as the ones she gave at her school, it was not bad. Three months later, she oversaw Satoru's work in the redone refinery, punching his arm while wondering why he was yet to invent anything and remarking that her father raised her better than waltzing in on someone whenever she felt like it.[20]\n" +

            "Toph drags Ty Lee off\n" +
            "Toph dragged Ty Lee off to the Fire Nation circus in order to cheer her up.\n" +
            "Sometime later, Toph visited the Fire Nation Capital to discuss political matters with Zuko and Aang. After the meeting, she came by the training Kyoshi Warriors. Noticing Ty Lee sitting nearby, Toph greeted her with a punch on the arm, briefly cheering up the young chi blocker. Asking if she should not be training, Toph learned that Ty Lee needed a break as nothing felt right to her anymore. Believing to know what was needed to \"punch [her] aura back in place\", Toph dragged her friend off to the Fire Nation circus. There, Ty Lee immediately became excited, prompting Toph to question why she never went back to being a circus acrobat. While Ty Lee was explaining, her old circus master pushed her into a nearby tent, and following her, Toph quickly became startled upon seeing \"a whole bunch of [Ty Lees]\". Ty Lee introduced her to her twin sisters, with whom she had long lost contact. After the family reunion evolved into an argument, causing a frustrated Ty Lee to storm out of the tent, Toph tried to cheer up the chi blocker by saying that she was her favorite out of all the Ty sisters. She also convinced a still annoyed Ty Lee to stay at the circus and attend a performance to show support for the platypus bears.\n" +
            "During the performance, Toph attempted to encourage the platypus bears to rebel against their trainer while listening to Ty Lee's realization about the reasons for her depression. As they headed out after the show, right before the Ty sisters' performance, Toph heard two people plotting to burn the tent down. Cronfronting the men about their plans, Toph was met with scorn, causing her to mock them before burying the firebender in a wave of dirt with her earthbending. At her urging, Ty Lee attacked the other offender, though she could not overpower the large man. Before Toph could help the chi blocker, however, her twin sisters overwhelmed the man, much to Ty Lee's joy. After returning to the capital, Toph told Suki of Ty Lee's intention to leave the Kyoshi Warriors, though Ty Lee had changed her mind.[21]\n" +

            "Work as Chief of Police\n" +
            "Chief Toph Beifong\n" +
            "Toph became Chief of Police in Republic City.\n" +
            "After the formation of Republic City, Toph was placed at the head of its law enforcement, and became the city's first Chief of Police.[11] Her metalbending knowledge allowed her to found an elite team, the Metalbending Police Force, to aid her in her duties.\n" +
            "Sometime before 120 AG, Toph met Kanto, with whom she had a daughter, Lin. The relationship did not work out, however, and six years later, she had another daughter, Suyin, with another man, though ended up raising them as a single parent. Both daughters inherited her earthbending abilities and became masters in their own right. Seeking to give them a different childhood than the one she had, Toph gave her daughters the freedom to find their own path. Lin would later follow in her footsteps as the Chief of Police, while Suyin became a rebel, much like her mother when she was young.[12] In 124 AG, Toph commissioned a friend to illustrate her first encounter with Aang during Earth Rumble VI to include in a book the latter was assembling for his son, Tenzin.[22]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In 128 AG, at age forty, Toph was on her way to arrest a man named Yakone for being a practitioner of the illegal art of bloodbending and using it to terrorize Republic City. Although mildly annoyed that Avatar Aang asked to accompany her, she let him join her, although she could not resist calling him by her childhood nickname for him, \"Twinkle Toes\", much to his annoyance.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Yakone bloodbending Toph\n" +
            "Chief Toph was bloodbent by Yakone to unlock his chains.\n" +
            "Having apprehended Yakone at Kwong's Cuisine, she brought him to be tried before the United Republic Council. However, right after he was found guilty of his crimes, Yakone used his bloodbending abilities to incapacitate Sokka. Coming to the aid of her friend, Toph was immobilized by the illegal bending art as well and was forced to use her keys to free Yakone of his handcuffs before being harshly tossed aside and incapacitated.[23]\n" +
            "In 141 AG, after Lin caught Suyin trying to flee from an arrest for theft, the sisters were brought into Toph's office. Not wanting Suyin to go to prison, Toph destroyed Suyin's police report and sent her to live with her parents. She retired from the police force a year later due to guilt. At the same time, Suyin would later travel the world, eventually building a metal city, Zaofu. Toph and Suyin later reconciled, though Lin refused to participate.[8] Toph would visit Suyin in Zaofu from time to time, regaling her granddaughter, Opal, with stories about Lin, until she left to travel around the world in search of enlightenment. According to Aiwei, she has not been seen since.[12]\n" +

            "174 AG\n" +
            "Meeting Avatar Korra\n" +
            "Elderly Toph\n" +
            "At the age of 86, Toph lived by herself in the Foggy Swamp.\n" +
            "By 174 AG, Toph resided in the Foggy Swamp, where she one day found Korra passed out in a pool of mud. She took the unconscious Avatar back to her home and laid her to rest in her bed while she made a meal. When Korra awoke and requested to know what had happened, Toph answered that she was hoping Korra would be able to tell her that. She revealed that she had known about Korra's presence due to being connected with her surroundings. Upon being asked if she was the person Korra was supposed to find, Toph merely stated that if Korra was led to her by her Avatar senses, she probably needed to listen to them. When Korra grew surprised over being recognized as the Avatar, Toph revealed that she had been good friends with her in a previous life and greeted the young woman as \"Twinkle Toes\".[13]\n" +
            "The following day, Korra asked Toph to help her get back into Avatar fighting shape, as she was currently in no condition to help the world, which she believed to need her. Upon hearing Korra say that, Toph briskly told the young woman to get over herself as the world did not need her at all, clarifying that while she was Chief of Police of Republic City, she had worked relentlessly to stop crime, though eventually realized that while the names changed, the street remained the same. Despite this and wanting to soak her feet in mud for a few weeks, Toph still decided to train Korra, stating that she simply could not stand the Avatar to be \"so pathetic and getting [her] butt kicked all the time\". As Korra surged forward to embrace her, she created an earth wall against which Korra crashed and fell down, stating that if the young woman wanted to hug something, she could go find a tree as they were there to work.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph defeats Korra\n" +
            "Toph easily defeated Korra in their sparring match.\n" +
            "Toph faced Korra in a sparring match, during which she easily sidestepped three of Korra's airbending attacks and a water strike, before knocking the Avatar down with a mud pillar. As Korra was gathering her bearings, Toph asked her to reflect on what she did wrong and pointed out that the young woman should not think during battle. Turning her back to Korra, she ordered her to go again. She easily avoided Korra's elemental barrage and defeated her with one mud pillar once again. Walking up to Korra lying in a shallow water pool, the earthbender berated her for her \"pathetic\" performance, declaring her to be by far the worst of the two Avatars she worked with. As Korra defended herself by pointing out that it merely looked like Toph was enjoying to have someone around to beat up, the elderly woman agreed with her, since the local swampbenders could not take a punch in her opinion. She took offense to Korra's insinuation that she was disconnected from the world by having retreated into the swamp, declaring that she was more connected than Korra had ever been as she could tap in to the swamp's vines to see all that went on in distant cities, like Zaofu and Republic City. As Korra attempted to test that statement by attacking her from behind, Toph knocked her down with a mud stream, stating Korra to be the blind one compared to her.\n" +
            "Walking through the swamp, Toph giddily talked about how much fun she had had tormenting the Avatar again, although she wished the girl had put up more of a fight. As Korra dejectedly noted that Toph had tossed her around like a ragdoll the entire time, the elderly woman laughed heartily at it, urging the Avatar to imagine how it would have been if she would still have been in her prime, saying she would have destroyed Korra. As Korra lamented about her inability to recover her old form, Toph told her there were still traces of mercury in her body. Realizing Korra had been oblivious to those remnants, she berated the young woman for \"truly\" being the worst Avatar ever. When the Avatar revealed to have been under the impression that Suyin had extracted all the poison, Toph stated that she believed neither of her daughters had picked up metalbending well. As Korra excitedly latched onto her, asking if Toph would be able to remove what Suyin could not, the elderly earthbender pushed her away, peeved about the fact that Korra even needed to ask about her abilities.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph bending mercury\n" +
            "Toph attempted to bend the residual mercury out of Korra's body, though she gave up after the Avatar kept fighting her subconsciously.\n" +
            "Returning to Toph's home, Toph ordered Korra to relax in order for her to complete a successful extraction. The moment she started, however, Korra shot up and grunted in pain, prompting Toph to berate her for not being relaxed. She ordered the young woman to stop fighting her and tried again, though with the same result. Annoyed about Korra's subconscious resistance, Toph gave up and stated that Korra would have to bend the metal out herself, since she was adamant about keeping it in her body for the time being. When a perplexed Korra asked her why she would want to keep poison in her body, Toph believed Korra to use it as an excuse to forsake her duties as the Avatar out of fear of getting injured again. Toph walked away as she did not want to deal with Korra's issues. Upon being asked by Korra what she was supposed to do, the elderly earthbender deferred Korra to the spirit that brought her to the swamp in the first place. Toph added that if Korra's wish was to find a place where she could disappear, she had come to the right swamp.[24]\n" +
            "Bored Korra and relaxing Toph\n" +
            "Toph was content with doing nothing and wanted to spend her days relaxing, much to Korra's annoyance.\n" +
            "In the following two days, Toph resumed her old habits of passing her time by relaxing. When Korra asked about their plans for the third day, Toph hinted that she wanted to continue doing nothing. This was not entertaining enough for the restless Avatar, who asked the elderly woman to retell the story of how she taught Aang to earthbend. Toph dismissed the question as there was no story there, considering she merely \"threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got all whiny, and Sokka fell in a hole\". As an excited Korra asked to hear the story about how Team Avatar had taken down the Fire Lord, Toph grew annoyed and relayed the story in a few sentences, saying that \"it was hot. [She] was on a blimp. And [she thought] a giant turtle showed up.\" Upon being berated for being a terrible storyteller, she defended herself by declaring Korra to be a terrible listener. Although Toph tried to resume relaxing, she grew irritated by Korra restlessly tapping her foot on the floor. Raising the earth underneath the Avatar's feet to stop the tapping, she ordered the young woman to leave and collect some mushrooms for dinner, giving her directions as to where to go.\n" +
            "Toph helping Korra\n" +
            "Toph helped Korra to realize that she needed to let go of her fear of her past enemies if she wanted to be ready to face future threats.\n" +
            "As Korra failed to return, Toph set out to search for her and found her sitting on a root while staring into the water. Upon learning that Korra had been plagued by visions, Toph casually answered that she had figured something like that would occur. She was unfazed by Korra calling her a \"twisted, old lady\" for having wanted Korra to have those visions and explained that the swamp could sense her to be out of balance. If Korra was willing to listen, the swamp would teach her what she needed to learn. Asking why the Avatar believed she kept seeing her old enemies, she offered the advice to learn from them. Toph walked Korra through her visions, stating that Amon wanted equality for all, Unalaq brought the spirits back, and Zaheer believed in freedom. She reasoned that their problem had been that they were out of balance and took their ideologies too far. Although Korra acknowledged the reason in Toph's words, the young woman still did not understand why she was haunted by their visions and thus Toph explained that she needed to face her fears and stop fighting her old enemies if she ever wished to be able to deal with future enemies. Since Korra revealed that she did not know how to do that, Toph noted with irritation that Avatars needed \"a lot of hand-holding\", before ordering Korra to get up and follow her to the banyan-grove tree.\n" +
            "Arriving at the heart of the swamp, Toph explained that the roots of the banyan-grove tree connected the entire swamp and added that Korra's problem was that she had been disconnected for too long from those who loved her and from herself. As Korra tapped in to the connection of the swamp and excitedly revealed that she had seen Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo, Toph commented dryly that she hoped the tree were there to take Korra home. Upon being introduced to the young airbenders, Toph revealed to them that their grandfather had been a \"real pain in [her] butt\". When Meelo recognized her due to her age, crankiness, and blindness, Toph commented that she liked the young boy.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Korra hugging Toph\n" +
            "Toph allowed Korra to embrace her, deeming that she had earned that right.\n" +
            "The five of them returned to Toph's dwelling in the swamp, where Toph reminded Korra that she was not going to bend out the mercury, as it was something the Avatar needed to do herself. She instructed Korra to close her eyes and clear her mind in order to focus her energy and find the metal. As Korra panted in pain, Toph reassured her that the vision she was seeing was of a fight in the past and that she needed to release the fear connected to it. When Korra succeeded to bend all the residual mercury out of her system, Toph enclosed it into a rock and complimented the Avatar on her achievement. She allowed Korra to embrace her, deeming that the young woman had earned that right, though only reciprocated with a mild pat on the back. When Tenzin's children and Korra said their goodbyes and left the swamp on Pepper, Toph was glad to have some peace and quiet again.[25]\n" +
            "Saving her family\n" +
            "Toph and Opal\n" +
            "Toph was glad to reunite with her only granddaughter, Opal.\n" +
            "By keeping an eye on Zaofu via the vines of the Foggy Swamp, Toph saw that Suyin and her family had been captured by Kuvira. She traveled to the metal city, though by the time she arrived, her daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren had already been moved to a prison camp. She later found Lin, Opal, and Bolin surveying the area around the city in order to determine where Suyin and the rest of the Beifong family were held captive. Approaching them, she told her daughter they should not bother trying to get closer to the city, since the prisoners had been transported elsewhere. When Lin greeted her as \"chief\", she acknowledged her daughter in the same fashion, before being warmly hugged by Opal. Entangling herself from the embrace, Toph fondly noted that Opal only reached to her waist the last time they had been together. Her demeanor switched to annoyance, however, when Bolin started to hysterically squeal and hop up and down over being in her presence and she abrasively asked him if he needed to use the bathroom. Ignoring Bolin's antics for the rest, she included the threesome on her discovery that Suyin and her family had been moved to a prison camp. When Bolin pinpointed its location to be that of a nearby factory and reeducation facility, Toph asked her granddaughter how she had ended up dating the kind of \"dipstick\" that worked for Kuvira. Now knowing where to go, Toph was introduced to Juicy, though immediately noted that the \"leaky, nasty thing\" smelled worse than Appa.\n" +
            "En route to the factory, Toph told Bolin that it had been a \"little while now, couple years\" since she had seen Lin. As her daughter specified that it had been twenty years, she casually waved the comment off, noting that time flew for someone her age, and changed the subject to her wonder that Lin had come to save Suyin. She was pleased to learn that her daughters had moved past their grievances with each other, though failed to take note of Lin's grudge toward her.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph and Bolin\n" +
            "Much to Bolin's delight, Toph sensed that Zhu Li was lying when she told Kuvira that she was doing everything she could to fix the spirit energy cannon.\n" +
            "Arriving at the factory, they all sneaked in and Toph used her metalbending to tear a hole in the hangar's wall, before seamlessly sealing it again. She used her seismic sense to deduce Suyin and her family were being kept in a cavern underneath the factory; although it felt empty, she could sense the mecha suits guarding the place. When Kuvira entered the hangar, they all hid and overheard her conversation with Baatar Jr. and Zhu Li. When the latter told Kuvira that she was doing everything she could to fix the problems with the spirit energy cannon, Toph noted that she was lying, much to Bolin's delight.\n" +
            "Retreating back to the hills surrounding the facility, Toph noted with irritation that she had not come to fight with Kuvira or destroy a cannon, as Opal and Bolin, respectively, suggested to do and emphasized that she was solely there to save her family, adding that it would already take everything that they had to survive the endeavor. The foursome decided to postpone their rescue mission until the next day after Bolin reasoned that the most ideal moment to strike would be during the testing of the cannon, since Kuvira's desire to have all the troops and workers present would leave the factory mostly deserted.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Lin annoyed with Toph\n" +
            "As they had not seen each other in twenty years, Toph and Lin had unresolved issues, mainly regarding Toph's refusal to talk about Lin's father.\n" +
            "During dinner, Toph told Bolin that she used to have a metalbending academy where even a \"blockhead\" like him could have learned metalbending, ignoring Lin's sarcastic jab about her being a \"real sensitive instructor\". She was surprised to hear that Bolin had learned the rare skill of lavabending, complimenting him on the possibility of being talented after all, much to his excitement. When Lin scoffed at the conversation, sarcastically noting that Toph was \"real encouraging\", Toph bit back that she was blind, not deaf. Upon being asked who Lin's father was, she casually answered that he was a nice man named Kanto with whom it did not work out. Sensing her daughter's \"enraged breathing\", Toph ordered her to say whatever it was she wanted to say so they could \"get it over with\". Infuriated even more by that comment, Lin snapped at Toph that growing up without a father and never even discussing him weighed heavily on her, though her mother waved it off by stating that those were all things of the past. Being blamed for not knowing or caring why Lin was furious with her, Toph solemnly accepted her daughter's decision of not wanting anything more to do with her after they had saved Suyin if that was what would make her happy.\n" +
            "Liberation of the Beifong family\n" +
            "Toph helped Lin and Bolin to free Suyin and her family.\n" +
            "The following day, after Opal alerted them that the demonstration was about to start, Toph, Lin, and Bolin burrowed themselves a tunnel toward the underground cavern where the Beifong family was being held captive. Warning everyone that the guards were on the other side of the door at the opposite side of the chasm, she noted that they had to be quiet, lest they would be discovered. With Bolin's help, she catapulted Lin atop the wooden cell, so she could swing back all the prisoners on her cable and Bolin could catch them. Everything went well, until the acrophobic Baatar inadvertently alerted the guards to their presence. Despite this setback, they managed to free the entire family and Toph warmly hugged her youngest daughter, before they all made their way back to the surface and reunited with Opal. When Bolin declared he would save Zhu Li at the abandoned town that was to be blown up by the cannon, Toph stated that he did not know for sure that she was on their side as she could have been lying before to cover up a mistake she had made as opposed to deliberately sabotaging the machine as Bolin believed. After he and Opal left anyway, Toph declared to be through with fighting and refused to join Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing in their attempt to stop Kuvira. She stayed behind with Baatar and Huan, though when the former tried to make smalltalk, addressing her as \"mother\", she quickly shut him down by reminding him that he should never address her as such. Despite her initial refusal, Toph ultimately interfered in the battle when the foursome found themselves outnumbered and surrounded and saved them by shifting the earth underneath all their opponents, bringing them down. As Opal, Bolin, and Zhu Li returned on Juicy, Toph shouted at Kuvira that she gave metalbenders a bad name, before escaping to safety on the bison.\n" +
            "Toph and Lin reconciling\n" +
            "Both apologizing for their mistakes, Toph and Lin reconciled.\n" +
            "Landing in a bamboo forest, Toph was thanked by her daughters for having come to their rescue. When Lin apologized for all she had said the previous night, Toph acknowledged that she had not been the best mother, though was nonetheless proud of the women her daughters had become. She noted that if they could find it in their hearts to not hate her, that would be enough for her. She and Lin shared an embrace, though found their moment ruined by Bolin, who hugged them both, while emphasizing the importance of family using his own as an example. Irritated, Toph entangled herself from the embrace and sarcastically wished her family an enjoyable ride back to Republic City with the \"gumflapper\". Upon being asked by Opal if she was not joining them, Toph light-heartedly explained that her fighting days were over due to her old age and while walking away, she joyfully added that it was their time now.[26]\n" +
            "Legacy\n" +
            "Toph was hailed as a hero in Republic City following her retirement and a metal statue of her in her police uniform was placed in a niche above the main entrance of the police headquarters. Several statues of Toph were also built in Zaofu in honor of her discovery of metalbending.[8]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "Toph annoyed\n" +
            "Toph was comfortable with letting those around her know when she was displeased.\n" +
            "Upon joining Team Avatar, Toph brought a completely new personality to the group. Unlike the nurturing Katara, flighty Aang, or gruff but goofy Sokka, Toph was fiercely independent, sarcastic, direct, stubborn, and confrontational.[27] She appeared to have the same carefree and adventurous personality as Aang and was very tomboyish in the way she acted[27] and dressed,[28] in contrast to the delicate doll her parents saw her as. However, unlike Aang, who avoided fighting whenever possible, Toph loved battling and took great pride in her earthbending skills. She appeared eager to prove that she was as strong as anyone who could see and once claimed that she was \"the greatest earthbender in the world\".[29]\n" +
            "Toph's eagerness to prove that she could be independent led to some initial difficulties with Aang and his friends. Toph insisted that she could \"carry her own weight\" and often mistook a simple friendly gesture as an act of pity for her blindness. Her encounter with Iroh, however, taught her that Aang, Katara, and Sokka cared for her because they were friends, not because her disability made them feel obligated to do so.[27]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph was often brutally honest when criticizing others, especially her friends. She was vocal about her opinions on others regardless of status (the Avatar, Aang) or age (Iroh).[27] Her occasional attitude or aloofness is likely related to her being the only child of one of the richest families in the Earth Kingdom. Due to her time as a competitor and champion of earthbending tournaments, she was an expert in verbally taunting and insulting her opponents and, on occasion, her friends, particularly Sokka. She revealed to Katara that, being unable to see what she looks like, she did not feel the need to fuss over her appearance.[28] However, despite her many quirks, Toph showed that she was a quick learner,[30] and her courage and loyalty to her new friends seemed very stable.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph and Katara seemed to be polar opposites; while Katara was kind, welcoming and supportive, Toph was rough, unyielding and steadfast. These differences in personality extended to the way both girls taught Aang; however, Toph eventually showed a bit of compromise in order to help Aang through his initial difficulty with earthbending.[31] Despite occasional clashes or spats,[32] Toph and Katara generally got along.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph spits\n" +
            "While raised in a wealthy and prominent Earth Kingdom family, Toph deliberately lacked manners as a form of rebellion.\n" +
            "One of Toph's most profound traits involved personal hygiene. She was accustomed to lying on the ground and walking everywhere barefoot leaving her soles soiled, a habit common among the earthbenders. Also, she had been seen belching loudly, picking her nose or toes,[33] spitting, and was usually covered in dirt or, as she called it, \"a healthy coating of earth\".[28]\n" +
            "Toph was well-educated in the manners and bearings of high society â€” she merely consciously and constantly chose to ignore them. She made an exception when the group needed to go to a special party to see the Earth King, in order to give news of the solar eclipse, only to meet the head of the Dai Li, Long Feng.[34]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph did not let her blindness hurt her self-confidence. She had high self-esteem in regard to many of her abilities and was more than determined to show that she would not let her blindness deter her from living freely and fighting like everyone else. However, sometimes this acted as a ruse to hide personal insecurities. After getting a makeover with Katara in Ba Sing Se, some residents of the city mocked Toph for it (who retaliated with a prank). She told Katara that \"one of the good things about being blind [was] that [she did] not have to waste [her] time worrying about appearances\" and was not looking for anyone's approval. Katara voiced that it was something she admired in Toph but could tell that she had been hurt by the insult and added that though it did not matter, she was in fact pretty, which visibly cheered up the blind girl.[28]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph&#039;s blindness\n" +
            "A laid-back individual, Toph is fine with her blindness.\n" +
            "An ongoing joke concerning Toph's blindness was her lack of ability to discern anything that had been written or drawn. In Ba Sing Se, Toph became angry when Sokka suggested that she needed help distributing fliers. She angrily slapped up a poster herself, only to inadvertently place it backward and say, \"It's upside-down, isn't it?\" Also, she sarcastically complimented Sokka on his drawings of Appa despite the obvious fact that she could not see them.[35] Later, in the Fire Nation, after being presented with the same wanted poster twice, Toph vocally expressed her annoyance with the constant oversight.[32] Toph was comfortable enough, however, with the group's absent-mindedness on the subject of her blindness to even joke about it herself at times. For example, while searching for Wan Shi Tong's Library, Toph, while flying on Appa, claimed that she saw it, before remarking, \"That's what it'll sound like when one of you spots it\", and waving a hand in front of her eyes with a nonchalant smile.[36]\n" +
            "While hijacking an airship, Toph mistook Sokka's comment about taking the wheel, thinking he was referring to her. By the smile on her face, it was pretty clear that she was gleeful about getting another chance to correct him. However, it turned out that Sokka was talking to Suki, and Toph managed to subsequently cover up her original intention pretty well.[37] At the reunion in the Jasmine Dragon after the passing of Sozin's Comet, she made a joke about Sokka's drawing, saying that she thought everyone looked perfect.[38]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Because of the restrictions placed upon her by her parents and the fact that their servants waited upon her hand-and-foot lest she hurt herself, Toph often seemed to want to take on the responsibilities and obtain the freedoms of adulthood. This caused problems for herself and her friends, most notably during their visit to Fire Fountain City, as she did not always take into account how this might endanger her or aggravate others. No matter how she acted, though, others realized that she was still a vulnerable child underneath everything else she pretended to be.[32]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When she went on to teach her unique talent of metalbending, she realized how her dogged pursuit of her own dreams of becoming the world's first metalbending teacher disrespected who her students were. She found parallels between how she was treating them as people by restricting them simply so they could meet her vision of them with how her parents had treated her back when she still lived with them. She subsequently decided to give up her metalbending academy so that she would not use it as an outlet for the pain she felt from her relationship with her parents onto her students. Luckily for her, her students happened to have overheard her conversation with Sokka about this subject, and responded to it by overcoming the limits the rest of the world saw as defining them in an attempt to live up to the vision Toph had had for them, and were finally able to metalbend.[15]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Due to her troubled past with her parents, Toph also exhibited a modernist attitude, believing that change is the key to progress.[18]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As a mother, Toph found herself to be a direct opposite of her parents, letting her daughters be free to find their own way, though Suyin claimed that Toph was not pleased with the paths either of her daughters had chosen. She later admitted to her children that, while she knew she had not been the best parent, she was proud of the women they had become.[26]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In old age, Toph retained her abrasive, no-nonsense personality, being harshly critical of Korra's abilities and enjoying defeating her in combat. However, she had adopted a more cynical mindset about the impact actions make on their surroundings; she had realized that no matter how hard she tried, crime and injustice would never give up.[24]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Despite her tough exterior, Toph is not above warming up during intimate moments, as evidenced when she joined in group hugs with Team Avatar and held hands with Aang at the prospect of friendships lasting more than one lifetime.[39] Although she had become more cynical in old age, she would allow herself to show affection when she deemed the other person worthy, as evidenced when she let Korra hug her after earning her respect[25] and did not berate or try to stop Opal's embrace when they met again after several years of separation.[26]\n" +

            "Abilities\n" +
            "Earthbending\n" +
            "Earth column\n" +
            "When Toph joined Team Avatar, her earthbending capabilities made it obvious that she would be a promising asset for the team.\n" +
            "Toph's proclamation of being the most powerful earthbender in the world is supported by her talented displays of earthbending since a young age.[29] Although blind, Toph's training in earthbending under the original earthbenders, the badgermoles, allowed her to use their unique ability of seismic sense: she used earthbending to \"feel\" even the most minute vibrations in the earth, including the march of ants several meters away and the presence of trees and buildings.[1] Through this heightened seismic sense, Toph could visualize where people were, their relative distance to her, and their physical build, but was unable to visualize faces.[28] This sense provided her with a distinct advantage when facing other earthbenders in combat, because she could predict attacks as they began and quickly react.[1] Her knowledge of the art also allowed her to teach it to others like Aang, and later her daughters, Lin and Suyin. Her speed and agility were also greatly beneficial in combat.\n" +
            "Her earthbending style was unique and thus unpredictable, as her training was unconventional and more deeply rooted into the nature of earthbending rather than just pure fighting. This style greatly differentiated from the rigid training and fighting style that earthbenders like the Dai Li implemented. Toph's style tended to be proven to be superior to the Dai Li, as she was able to take on a number of them and defend her friends at the same time.[35] This is likely because while the Dai Li just manipulated the earth, Toph had established a tremendously deep connection to it at the very outset of her self-tutelage in earthbending (although both styles have an over dependence on something i.e. the Dai Li and their earth gloves and Toph and her feet).\n" +
            "\n" +
            "However, because Toph was dependent on vibrations in the earth, she was vulnerable to air-based attacks, as shown in her fight with Aang in Earth Rumble VI. Later, Toph was completely surprised by Sokka dropping a large belt on her head.[1] Her success rate in intercepting projectiles was also tied to her sensing of vibrations, being able to feel an opponent's movement, and proceeding accordingly. By her own admission, she could not aim properly at opponents while they were airborne.[40]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph&#039;s seismic sense\n" +
            "Toph uses her seismic sense to feel her surroundings and anticipate the motions and attacks of her enemy.\n" +
            "Terrain that impaired Toph's ability to sense vibrations also hindered her abilities, as shown when Toph had some difficulty with sand, describing the vibrations in the earth as \"fuzzy\". She was able to compress sand into solid rock to gain some temporary footing, but was still unable to accurately aim attacks under those conditions.[40] However, she seemed to have ultimately gained some mastery of sandbending, as she mentioned working on it during Team Avatar's beach party and was able to create a miniature version of the upper ring of Ba Sing Se in rich detail. Apparently, her ability to sense vibrations had improved, which may be how she was able to produce the very fine details of the city and did not show the same helplessness she had shown when previously walking on sand when the gang stepped onto the beach.[30] By 174 AG, Toph attained a state of enlightenment similar to Huu, being able to use the connections of the swamp she lived in with her senses to survey the world and observe everyone.[25]\n" +
            "Toph also expressed an aversion for flying[2] and submarine travel,[41] as she could not sense her surroundings without her feet on solid ground. Also, as a result of her closeness or affinity with earth, Toph could rest or sleep comfortably on solid rock without any sleeping bag or blanket and could walk on any kind of terrain in bare feet, a standard trait for earthbenders. Toph relied on direct contact between her feet and the ground for \"sight\"[42] as well as for her earthbending. Toph was very reluctant to allow anyone else to touch her feet,[28] probably because insensitive handling there would make her deaf to other vibrations and thereby render her helpless (and because they were far more sensitive than other people's feet).\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Despite her substantial prowess on land, Toph did not perform well in water and on ice. She seemed incapable of seeing where she was going on ice, was not able to swim,[3] and became nauseous when she needed to travel by submarine in the invasion of the Fire Nation.[41]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In Ba Sing Se, Toph was seen feeling even slight vibrations as she told a man they met, \"I can feel you shaking.\"[34] Also, Toph demonstrated an ability to sense when a person was lying by the vibrations of his/her heartbeat and breathing patterns.[35] However, Toph's ability to detect lies was not absolute, as Azula demonstrated when she was easily able to lie without even the slightest physical reaction.[43] However, very few people have the ability to lie while manipulating their breathing and pulse in this way.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph's earthbending style was based on Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis, which is a style that is apparently unique to her; the style of earthbending used by other earthbenders is rooted in the Hung Gar style of Kung Fu. She was the only bender known to use a style based on a different root martial art than the standard for their bending art. This may be because she was self-taught rather than trained in the traditional earthbending form. Toph came to develop her unique style by observing the movements of the also blind earthbending badgermoles that could be found in the caves around her hometown.[9] By 174 AG, Toph's fighting style evolved to incorporate more fluid and evasive maneuvers, bending mud more akin to waterbending.[25]\n" +

            "Toph sandbending\n" +
            "Toph demonstrated to Aang her practice of sandbending.\n" +
            "Because sand is loose and ultimately always changing with the winds of the desert, Toph found it hard to navigate through and control. To compensate somewhat, she could condense the sand together to give her a better footing. However, when she tried to attack one of the sandbenders with a small wave of sand during their ambush of her and Appa, she missed, her lack of precision on the sand aggravated by her hurry to save both Appa and the others.\n" +
            "After the events in the Si Wong Desert had shown her inability to see effectively while walking on sand,[40] Toph practiced her sandbending, eventually achieving a mastery over it that allowed her to create an extremely detailed sand version of Ba Sing Se during her time relaxing at Ember Island.[30]\n" +

            "Main article: Metalbending\n" +
            "Toph in metal armor\n" +
            "A fluid earthbending master, Toph mastered metalbending to the level she could use it as systematically as earth itself.\n" +
            "Toph discovered the ability to bend metal in the spring of 100 AG. Metal is derived from ore, which is found in the earth. Guru Pathik explained to Aang that \"metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined\". Because of Toph's ability to feel the vibrations in earth, she was able to locate the impurities (the small fragments of earth) still found in most metals and manipulate them to \"bend\" the metal portion. By acquiring these metalbending abilities, Toph had shown herself to be one of the most powerful and ingenious earthbenders in the world, being the only known earthbender to ever bend metal during the Hundred Year War, a feat that even the Avatar was unable to perform since the origin of earthbending.[29]\n" +
            "When Sokka finished his training as a sword master, he gave Toph a small piece of meteorite, which, being composed of earth and metal, she could easily mold into a myriad of shapes,[33] subsequently transforming it into an arm bracelet which she would wear.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "She originally used an underdeveloped form of metalbending and usually needed to have direct contact with the element to manipulate it at all, let alone skillfully. However, she continued to practice her metalbending and started to display a dexterous control over metal.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In Wulong Forest, when she was breaking into a Fire Nation airship, it was shown that her metalbending had improved greatly, as she created metal armor and manipulated the metallic structure of the room with far more ease than before, moving metal more fluidly. She was also able to crawl along the metal ceiling while completely covered in metal. Additionally, Toph could metalbend outside of her metal armor, even though she was already bending the armor in the first place.[37]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "A year later, Toph could bend metal that she was not in contact with, like when she demonstrated her ability to bend metal to Kunyo, who was trying to take over the metalbending school, by bending a metal weapon around his head. She later stated that as long as someone could see the metal, she could bend it, which she demonstrated when metalbending screws and bolts to unscrew the wheels of Fire Nation tanks.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph later taught this self-invented technique to many earthbenders, including her daughters. After the Hundred Year War, Toph further refined metalbending to the point of being able to start and lead a capable law enforcement group of metalbending police officers. Following Toph's retirement, Lin Beifong became the new Chief of Police, demonstrating her prodigious metalbending and leadership abilities. Despite all of her accomplishments in the development of metalbending, Toph never succeeded in bending pure metals such as platinum.[44] She was, however, able to sense even trace amounts of metal, unlike her daughters.[24] Her proficiency in metalbending was such that she could tear a hole in a metal wall and restore it to its previous state without a trace of it ever having been bent.[26]\n" +

            "Toph as Melon Lord\n" +
            "Toph pretended to be the Melon Lord.\n" +
            "Despite her lack of actual sight, her remaining senses, primarily her sense of touch and hearing, were especially acute, allowing her to use her seismic sense to remarkable levels. With the latter sense, she once claimed herself that she \"never [forgot] a voice\". This was shown when the gang traveled through the Si Wong Desert, where they were confronted by a group of sandbenders and she almost immediately recognized one as one of the sandbenders that kidnapped Appa the day before.[40] Later in the summer, while the gang was on a captured Fire Nation ship, Hakoda and Bato seemingly deceived the captain of another ship, but the captain realized the ship as a captured one. Toph overheard the captain whispering to his troops to sink the ship and attacked.[45] While visiting a creepy village in the Fire Nation, Toph heard people screaming all the way from atop a mountain and everyone later deduced that that was where several prisoners were being held.[46]\n" +
            "Toph also showed a decent amount of artistic talent, as she was able to create a realistic replica of the city of Ba Sing Se with sandbending while Team Avatar stayed at Ember Island, contrasting with Sokka's poor sculpting abilities when he created a sand sculpture of Suki. Later in a training exercise involving all of the members of the team, she was able to create earthbending mannequins while acting as the \"Melon Lord\"[30] (who was in reality an inanimate mannequin made to resemble the Fire Lord, supported by a small earth column and clothed in Fire Nation robes).\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As befits one who has mastered the use of neutral jing by waiting and listening to the earth, Toph had a great sense of hearing, able to clearly hear the most subtle of whispering from a considerable distances and could recognize people by the sound of their voices. In the Si Wong Desert, Toph recognized the sandbender who stole Appa, remarking as she did so that she never forgets a voice.[40] She likewise has very fine memory, able to accurately remember and distinguish the physical form of people as she quickly determined one of the Kyoshi Warriors was actually Ty Lee in disguise.[47]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "She also seemed to enjoy acting and showed a decent amount of talent at it, getting more into character as the \"Melon Lord\" than was necessary for Team Avatar's training purposes,[30] rebuffing Katara for acting out of character when Aang distracted her from their act of being noblewomen (as was made necessary for entry into the Earth King's party[34]), and reveling in the \"stage name\" given to her as \"The Runaway\".[32] This appreciation for \"getting into character\" as an actor was likely behind her greater ability to enjoy the The Boy in the Iceberg play relative to the rest of Team Avatar.[48]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "She also displayed a remarkable amount of agility for one who preferred to have her feet planted on the ground at all times. In Team Avatar's first battle with Combustion Man, she rolled, pushed herself off of the ground with one hand and flipped over in the air to regain her balance after his first shot. She positioned herself in an earthbending stance in order to fight back against her attacker as quickly as possible.[49] Toph apparently also had a good enough sense of balance and strong enough neck muscles to carry a basket full of groceries on her head\n";
    public static String descAzula = "Azula was the princess of the Fire Nation, daughter of Fire Lord Ozai and Ursa, younger sister of Zuko, older half-sister of Kiyi, aunt of Izumi, and great aunt of Iroh. She was a key adversary of Team Avatar,[4] chasing Avatar Aang and her banished brother far across the Earth Kingdom accompanied by her two best friends at the time, Mai and Ty Lee.\n" +
            "A firebending prodigy, Azula was sadistic, manipulative, and obsessed with power. She was a skilled strategist who orchestrated the coup over the Earth Kingdom capital Ba Sing Se,[5][6] and halted the invasion on the Day of Black Sun.[7]\n" +
            "Azula harbored deep mental instabilities, believing her mother loved Zuko more than her.[8] Raised by her father in an environment without a mother-figure, Azula had to be nothing less than perfect in her father's eyes just to earn any affection from him. After the betrayal of her two closest friends Mai and Ty Lee, these instabilities were brought up to the surface.[1] Upon the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Azula was soon to be crowned Fire Lord;[9] however, her defeat at the hands of her brother Zuko and Katara caused her to suffer a complete mental breakdown.[10]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Following her emotional breakdown, Azula was put in a mental health institution to recover, though she eventually joined Team Avatar on their search for Ursa as part of her secret agenda to betray them and usurp the throne from Zuko. At this quest's completion, however, Azula escaped the team's supervision.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sometime after her exile, Azula returned to the Fire Nation Capital in secret. Having finally accepted that she would never be Fire Lord, Azula resorted to manipulate Zuko into becoming a tyrant. Gathering a group of female supporters, she took on the guise of the mythical Kemurikage to intimidate Ukano into attempting to overthrow Zuko. When that failed, Azula and her followers resorted to kidnapping children in the capital, setting the city into unrest. Though Zuko and his allies were able to rescue the children, Azula and her followers escaped.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After her Agni Kai with Zuko and subsequent mental breakdown, Azula was committed to a mental health facility on a nearby island, where she was continuously monitored.[12] About a year later, she was visited by her brother, who told her that he had consulted with Ozai on several occasions in an attempt to learn Ursa's whereabouts, to no avail. Answering his request for help, Azula said that she needed nothing in return for her assistance, as the mere knowledge of being of service to the Fire Lord would be enough satisfaction. She also stated that she had been wondering as well what exactly happened to their mother following her disappearance six years earlier.[17]\n" +
            "She was placed in an adjoining cell with her father, though they did not speak with each other for half an hour. Zuko observed this and brought them tea in an attempt to make the situation more enjoyable. Azula grabbed hold of the tray with her teeth, however, causing Zuko to fall over. She angrily accused him of wanting to see her lap up the beverage like an animal, since she would have had no other way to drink it while confined in her straitjacket. Her outburst prompted Ty Lee to chi block her, rendering her completely immobile. Upon seeing her old friend, her psychosis made her question the girl as to how \"she\", referring to Ursa, had managed to break the grasp of fear Azula used to have on her. Before the situation could escalate any further, Zuko intervened and stated that he had meant no harm and just wanted to ease the conversation with Ozai along. After being placed on her chair again, the chi blocked Azula arrogantly stated that if her brother wanted her and their father to have a dignified conversation, he should leave them alone, which he did.[18]\n" +
            "When Zuko was taking her back to her old quarters in the palace where she would be staying, he asked her whether or not she had been able to coax the needed information about Ursa's whereabouts from Ozai. She dodged the question and asked in return whether or not he had ever experienced the sensation of being chi blocked. When Zuko said he had not, she proceeded to meticulously describe the feeling, mentioning that one becomes extremely flexible right before regaining their full control. To prove her words, she twisted her arm out of her straitjacket and fired a lightning bolt at her brother. In the ensuing skirmish, she managed to free herself entirely and made her way into a nearby building. Via a hidden passageway, she went to one of Ozai's secret chambers where she retrieved a stack of undelivered letters, which Ursa had written to her hometown. Before Zuko could take them from her, she burned them, having already read them herself. She concealed one of them, however, though let her brother believe that all had been destroyed. In return for knowledge about what had been written in the allegedly burned letter, she requested to be allowed to go with him on his search for their mother.[18]\n" +
            "Complying to the request, Zuko released her from the mental hospital and allowed her to accompany him, unbound and with dignity. When she showed herself to Team Avatar, however, she was immediately attacked by Katara. She easily dodged their attacks and proceeded to taunt and insult Sokka. It did not come to a scuffle until the next day, when a short struggle ensued between her and Sokka. Azula disarmed him with a small, non-lethal lightning shock after he threatened her with his boomerang. The rest of the team immediately intervened and immobilized her with their bending. Upon her release, she haughtily stated that if they all just stayed away from her, they would get along perfectly.[18]\n" +
            "She traveled with Team Avatar on Appa to Hira'a to find her mother, but her mood was erratic, unpredictable, and characterized by symptoms of psychosis, as she constantly asked Team Avatar how \"she\" had contacted them, referring to her mother. Upon nearing Hira'a, she attempted to escape by jumping off of Appa. Aang swooped down and caught her in free fall, but she set his glider afire, causing him to crash to the ground and securing her getaway. She ran away, but stopped as she neared a stream and heard her mother's voice coming from the water. She argued with the reflection, accusing Ursa of desiring to ruin her from the day she was born and heading a conspiracy to strip her of her power, of which she also claimed her mother had been jealous. However, she triumphantly stated that thanks to Ursa's letter, she now had all the proof she needed to take the throne from Zuko. She thus revealed her own plans to find and kill Ursa herself in order to stop her once and for all. She let out an emotionally toiled scream as the hallucination of her mother confirmed her love for her, prompting Azula to fire a lightning bolt at the mirage, stating the love declaration to be nothing more as Ursa's last treasonous attempt to set her own mind against her.[18]\n" +
            "At that point, Zuko arrived and asked to whom she had been speaking. Reacting aggressively, Azula wanted to strike her brother down but was encased in ice by Katara before she got the chance. As the waterbender approached her, she accused her of being one of Ursa's co-conspirators. Her rant, however, was interrupted when the wolf spirit appeared and attacked the group. As they were being overpowered by moth wasps coughed up by the spirit, Azula asked Zuko to free her so she could help, convincing him that she could not possibly make things worse for them and stating that if he could not even trust his own family, there was no one left to be trusted. He melted her icy restraints, and true to her word, she created a large lightning bolt and shot it away from the group, drawing the light-oriented moth wasps and wolf spirit with it. That night, Azula was talking in her sleep and shivering from the cold before Zuko covered her with a blanket.[18]\n" +
            "The next day, the princess was awoken by another hallucination of Ursa. She was urged by her mother to stop what she was doing, as Ursa believed it was not Azula's destiny to assume the throne. In response, Azula intended to shoot her mother with lightning, but Ursa only pleaded with her more urgently to find her true destiny. Azula snapped out of her hallucination with Katara's hand in her grip; Sokka prepared his boomerang to strike her, but Katara managed to calm the unstable firebender down. After her outburst, Azula discovered that the letter she had kept was missing and immediately assumed that Zuko had taken it. Her brother was not at camp, however, and Azula threatened Sokka and Katara with fire to force them tell her where Zuko had gone. After burning down a few nearby trees and bushes, she stormed off after Zuko.[14]\n" +
            "Azula found her brother sitting with Aang at the edge of a cliff. Frustrated, she shot fire blasts at him and a duel broke out. While Aang ran back to check up on Sokka and Katara, Azula was grabbed by Zuko and held over the cliff while she accused their mother of tipping him off to the letter's location, before learning that he had held it all night. Zuko requested that they stop their fighting, to which Azula agreed, and they both returned to camp. After the rest of the team put out the fires, the entire group continued their journey to Hira'a.[14]\n" +
            "They reached the border of Hira'a and the Team Avatar disguised themselves using crimson robes. Azula was the only one who still wore her own outfit. The group arrived just as a performance of Love amongst the Dragons was ending. Azula and Zuko recalled the times they used to see the play and how they acted out the battle scene; Azula bragged she made a better Dragon Emperor, which is why she took up the role between the two. The play ended, and Azula followed the others. They met the leader of the Hira'a acting troupe, Noren, who offered them information on Ursa in addition to tea and an invitation to his and his wife, Noriko's, home. Azula and Zuko spoke with the couple's daughter, Kiyi, about her doll. The princess mentioned she used to give her dolls \"headcuts\" instead of haircuts, offering one for Kiyi's doll, which scared the young girl and caused Zuko to berate his sister. Afterward, the firebender remarked that she was \"tempted to burn the whole place down, but resisted for [Zuko]\". The thought drew Katara's ire, causing the two girls to argue. The increasing tensions between Katara and Azula resulted in Zuko declaring that Forgetful Valley would be the last stop for the trip.\n" +
            "Upon arrival, Azula attempted to make a path by burning parts of the valley, drawing criticism from the rest of the group once more. When Aang found a flutter bat that brought him to a pond, Azula and the others followed the two there. The Avatar said it was a spiritual place and urged everyone to respect it, but Azula once again saw a hallucination of Ursa urging her to stop the mission. The princess promptly went against Aang's word and blasted the pond with lightning and yelled at Aang that Ursa had told him to bring them there. Katara was about to freeze her in place, but a rain of flower-shaped ice discs began to attack the team and the nearby plants began to pull the team in one by one. Azula saved Sokka from a vine, explaining that the more \"peasants\" she kept around, the higher her changes of survival were. Katara countered with plantbending and ordered whomever was attacking to reveal themselves to the team.\n" +
            "Rafa and Misu, brother and sister themselves, arrived and set up camp with the group. Misu warned them that Forgetful Valley's ponds needed to remained undisturbed. She told her and Rafa's story to the team; the sibling bond they had resulted in uncertain looks from Azula and her brother. The princess cut the story short and asked about Ursa, to which Misu replied that neither she nor Rafa had seen her. As Aang prepared to cross into the Spirit World to seek out the wolf spirit, Azula walked away; when confronted by Zuko, she snapped at him, wondering if they were really going to find their mother or help \"a couple of vagrants\". Zuko said that it was Aang's duty to help people, and Azula accused the Fire Lord of not wanting to hold the throne anymore, instead traveling with Team Avatar to help people. Her focus quickly shifted toward her psychotic beliefs, and she accused Ursa of orchestrating Rafa and Misu's arrival to throw them off her trail. She prepared to shoot lightning at the siblings, warning her mother that her plans would fail.[14]\n" +
            "Her attack was thwarted by Zuko, however, and she was forced to calm down, awaiting Aang's return. When the Avatar brought the Mother of Faces with him, Azula interrupted Misu's plea to the spirit to grant her brother a new face with a demand to know about Ursa. After learning that the Mother of Faces had given Ursa a new identity as Noriko, Azula promptly took off to Hira'a with her brother and Sokka chasing after her. Barging into Noren and Noriko's house, Azula was finally able to confront her mother, demanding to know if Kiyi was supposed to be her replacement because she was such a monster. Sokka held her off temporarily, but the princess ultimately slammed Ursa to the wall and prepared a ball of fire, intent upon killing her.\n" +
            "She teared up when her amnesiac mother apologized for not loving her enough, but after being separated from her by Zuko, she began attacking him. Azula asked Zuko why he would not allow her to take the throne, saying he would be free of something he did not want, while it would rid her of the \"incessant nagging in [her] head\". Upon being told that she was wrong, Azula protested, reminding him that he had the opportunity to throw her over the cliff and be rid of both her and the letter. Zuko answered that he knew the throne was his destiny and went on to say that no matter how messy their relationship was, she was still his sister. Azula, in tears, burned an opening through a nearby wall and ran outside, dropping the letter in the process. She ran off toward the Forgetful Valley, calling her brother weak when he begged her to stay so that he could help her, and vanishing from sight.[19] Although Zuko tried to find her in the weeks before he returned to the capital with Ursa, Ikem, Kiyi, and Team Avatar, Azula managed to remain hidden, which caused Zuko to believe that she did not want to be found.[20]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sometime during the Rift, Azula realized that her own destiny, was to help Zuko become the Fire Lord, that she wanted to be, she was inspired by the legends she'd heard about the original Kemurikage during the ancient times. Azula then left, Forgetful Valley and helped her friends from the institution and had the guise of the Kemurikage.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "They all returned to the Fire Nation, and working with Ukano, to help Ozai succeed the throne. One of her way's that she told Ukano, to help Ozai regain the throne is to capture the children. Along the following weeks, as Ukano, had failed to help Ozai on the throne, Azula along with the other Kemurikage had started stealing children. More and more children into a tomb.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The last capture, was Kiyi, as Zuko, Aang, Ty Lee and Suki tried to stop them all, Azula was able to redirect lighting towards her brother. Successfully capturing thirteen children and Kiyi, Zirin was starting to get very impatient with Azula about keeping the children for long. However, Azula calmly asked her and the other friends to be patience,as she had a plan. As Azula and Ukano, discuss how keeping the children, is going nowhere and Ukano's is upset that Tom-Tom is kept in. Azula wants to start riot in the streets, although Ukano doesn't understand how this will help Ozai, become Fire Lord, Azula softly said that her father was never the plan.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Later after the riot, Azula ask Ukano, how did it go. Ukano said that its still not making any progress, and states we have finally fulfil her wishes, and ask if the children can go. Azula allows Ukano to free the children, but states that if they are free, they will eventually tell their parents where they've kept them. So Ukano, allows the children to stay inside the tomb.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Later on, Azula and friends confront her brother, Aang, her old friend and Kei Lo. As they battle each other, Mai's knifes cuts into Azula's hood. Azula mocks her about how good her knife throwing is, and then attacks again. Azula then explains how, one time they were at a sleep over, and heard Mai's dream about the Kermurikage. Azula then attacks her again, and thanks for her and her friends inspiration. Kei Lo from behind bumps her, and Azula quickly grabs him. Azula threatens Kei Lo, and mocks Mai about her relationships. Zuko firmly ask Azula to let him go, and Azula states how Zuzu, is doing this to win Mai again, which is depressing.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As Azula and Zuko, both attack each other, with a fire blast, Azula runs off into their distant grandfather's tomb. Zuko chase her, just to have a talk about her. Azula states that they are in the tomb, of where the first Fire Lord was buried and Zuko asked how she got better. Azula and Zuko duel once more again, with Azula going on top of him. She states that she will never be Fire Lord, but revealed her own destiny and she is now free. As Zuko realises that the children free and have succeeded, Azula states that she accomplished her own destiny, making Zuko a ruthless tyrant for twenty four hours and becoming the Fire Lord she wanted to be.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As Zuko talks about his citizens, Azula and the Kemurikage look over, and with Azula's last word \"how touching\". They disappear once more and remain hidden.\n" +
            "Born a princess and hailed as a prodigy, Azula grew up to be narcissistic and confident. She relentlessly drilled herself toward perfection and settled for nothing less from herself or those who served her.[22] She believed that power and domination were the defining traits of strength, and as such would only help others if she thought there was some personal gain at stake. She had absolute confidence in her \"divine right to rule\", with which she believed she was born.[6] She harbored neither pity nor mercy for those she marked as treasonous or inferior. As one who wanted nothing less than absolute control, she likewise had remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure.\n" +
            "Azula was marked by a distinct lack of empathy. Even as a child, she reacted with hostility when outdone, a trait clearly displayed when she shoved Ty Lee to the ground after the girl bested her at gymnastics.[11] This behavior would characterize her relationship with her friends for many years. Although she could show sympathy toward them, she never cared for their feelings and manipulated them as she saw fit, such as when she intimidated Ty Lee into leaving the circus and joining her cause.[13]\n" +
            "She was prone to asserting herself and her authority in a grandiose way, such as when she humiliated Long Feng in front of his former henchmen,[6] or when she threatened the captain of her ship.[22] She also showed a need for admiration, mostly from her father, whom she emulated to a great degree, and from everyone else around her, though to a lesser extent. She reacted with despair and rage when she learned her father was going to the Earth Kingdom without her.[9]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Azula was known to have an extremely cruel personality. From a very young age, Azula demonstrated sadistic aggression and a near total lack of remorse to friends, servants, family, and animals. Her own mother, Princess Ursa, once remarked, \"What is wrong with that child?\" after observing her casual cruelties. Azula's first reaction to hearing of Iroh's son's death was to wonder whether this now made her father the heir to the throne. She later dismissed her uncle as a quitter and a loser when learning he had ended his six hundred day Siege of Ba Sing Se to grieve for Lu Ten.[11] She eagerly watched Azulon proclaim Ozai's punishment for trying to claim the throne and grinned maliciously when Zuko was burned and scarred by their father. She also did not seem to care when her mother disappeared or when her grandfather died.[15] Her cruelty was apparently infamous and extreme; when Iroh accidentally ingested the poisonous white jade flower, both he and Zuko quickly decided that they would rather go seek help from the Earth Kingdom and face certain death than deal with the Fire Nation and be handed over to Azula.[23]\n" +
            "Azula's characteristic blue flames symbolized the power she possessed and constantly sought to increase. Her apathy also accounted for her ability to create and direct lightning, the \"cold-blooded fire\".[22] According to Iroh, the skill required complete control of all emotion, which would not prove difficult for Azula with her one-track mentality.[24] Because of these skills, she was also an excellent tactician, regularly displaying cunning, perception, and resourcefulness that allowed her to take advantage of almost any situation. She possessed good self-control, facing down Long Feng and deceiving him when held captive,[6] and could lie with a straight face and no physical reactions.[7]\n" +
            "Ironically, for all her refinement and self-confidence, Azula did retain some insecurity. As a result of her sequestered life of royalty, she had developed a considerable amount of social ineptitude, particularly in her uncertainty of how to act around boys, and she frequently intimidated them during conversation. Her overly competitive nature surfaced during a kuai ball game, and she later admitted her jealousy over how much attention Ty Lee received from others.[8] Later, Azula began to show signs of a fragile mentality. For all of her self-assurance, she was momentarily driven into rage when Mai betrayed her by helping Zuko to escape and admitted to loving him more than she feared Azula. As Azula moved to strike her down, she was in turn temporarily paralyzed by Ty Lee. After her friends were apprehended, the enraged princess ordered both of them to be locked away and \"left to rot\".[7] While it was apparent that Azula held herself in high regard above her friends, their sudden betrayal drove her to the edge for an instant, hinting at just how unstable she would later prove to be.[1]\n" +
            "After being betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, Azula's mentality continued to crumble in the final weeks of the war. When she attacked Zuko and the gang at the Western Air Temple, Azula was evidently losing her sanity, as her attacks became far more vicious and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko.[25]\n" +
            "The tipping point came during her father's coronation as the Phoenix King, where Azula was told she would not assist in the attack on the Earth Kingdom. Azula seemed distraught at this and took this decision as an offense to her and her honor.[9] For her, Ozai always represented absolute power and perfection, qualities which she desired to acquire. His refusal to bring her along on a mission where the two of them would serve essentially as equals made her realize that her lust for power not only frightened her enemies, but perhaps her father as well. Ozai responded by appointing Azula as the new Fire Lord to govern over the Fire Nation in his absence, temporarily satisfying her desire for power. However, she was unable to cope with the fact that the only human being who may have ever loved her was not only ashamed of her, but also still possessed power over her. Her father was the last person Azula thought she could trust, and Ozai's refusal to include her in his final conquest only served to cause Azula more inner pain. Knowing that her father would neither submit to her will nor love her, Azula's grip on reality began to steadily plummet.\n" +
            "On the day of her coronation, Azula became excessively paranoid and gave into her fear of betrayal and being killed. She accused her servant of purposely leaving a pit in her cherry so that she would choke and got angry at the Dai Li when they arrived five minutes after they had been summoned, suggesting that their laxness could have allowed an assassin to sneak in, kill her, and \"be on his merry way\". Musing over the possibility that the Dai Li could betray and kill her, Mai and Ty Lee's treason still fresh in memory, she banished them.[1]\n" +
            "It also appeared that she was not sleeping well, as she had dark circles under her eyes. Upon Lo and Li's arrival to counsel her, Azula's fear of disappointing her father was clear. She became so enraged when her old mentors proposed to postpone her coronation, that she momentarily forgot they were not firebenders and ordered them to fight an Agni Kai with each other.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Having sent off her staff, she was left alone to style her own hair for the coronation. Frustrated by her inability to tie up her hair bun, she \"fixed\" the situation by cutting off a part of her hair, leaving it a tattered mess. Panting in frustration, she saw her mother in her mirror in an apparent hallucination. Ursa complimented her, saying that she always had such beautiful hair, though Azula dismissed the compliment and asked her mother why she was there. When Ursa told her that she would not miss her daughter's coronation, Azula told her not to pretend to act proud, stating that she knew her mother thought she was a monster. The hallucination of her mother refuted that, saying she did not think that, that Azula was just confused, and that she loved her. Azula could not cope with the declaration of love and threw her brush at the mirror, shattering it, before breaking down crying.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "This incident exposed a complex facet to Azula's persona. Although outwardly maintaining a cold and dismissive opinion of her mother, Ursa's banishment ultimately had a devastating impact upon Azula's fragile psyche.[8] As Azula's sanity began slipping away from her, this inability to reconcile her perceived belief that Ursa considered her a monster with the truer (though idealized) maternal feelings of love and support that Ursa demonstrated in the hallucination created an inescapable conflict in Azula's mind that furthered her eventual mental collapse.[1] Another thread of this argument explored the possibility that Azula may have harbored a guilt-ridden conscience, long suppressed or held at bay for many years by her indomitable will. Her conscience, in the form of her mother Ursa (whose love and guidance she secretly longed for but could never have) reared itself stronger than before. Ursa's gentle, motherly concerns over Azula's use of fear and cruelty as her only means of maintaining relationships with friends and family alike induced a violent mental breakdown prior to her coronation; after smashing a mirror, Azula collapsed and sobbed deeply before regaining any semblance of control.[1]\n" +
            "Visibly unstable, Azula saw a hallucination of her mother as she began to lose her sanity.\n" +
            "Azula showed up at her coronation impatient and with her hair still a mess, though the event was interrupted when Katara and Zuko arrived to challenge her. She did not hesitate to challenge her brother to an Agni Kai, though her unstable condition shone through visibly, as Zuko could easily pick up on it. During the battle, Azula constantly provoked and otherwise offended the duo, though her apparent madness interfered with her fighting abilities and Zuko was able to hold his ground and even gain the upper hand at times.[1] Azula was eventually defeated and chained to the ground by Katara. The Fire Nation princess screamed in anger and outrage, while breathing fire uncontrollably and furiously struggling to break herself free, falling into complete insanity, sobbing loudly. She dragged herself along the ground helplessly, as Zuko and Katara looked on in pity and horror.[10] This breakdown was the culmination of her failed relationship with her mother and her jealousy toward Zuko for receiving more of their mother's affection,[8] the betrayal she suffered at the hands of Mai and Ty Lee,[26] and finally, her defeat by Zuko and Katara. Azula was admitted into a mental health facility on a nearby island in the Fire Nation, where she was closely monitored and observed.\n" +
            "A year later, a clearly mentally unstable Azula accepted the task of coaxing Ursa's whereabouts out of Ozai from Zuko, stating that not one day had gone by where she had not wondered what became of their mother.[17] In return, she requested permission to join her brother on his quest and to be allowed to travel unbound and with dignity. The Fire Lord accepted and Azula was released. While she had regained much of her previous demeanor, as she haughtily commanded people to cater to her needs and forcefully reacted to irritating situations, though from time to time, she still suffered from psychotic episodes, thinking that everyone around her was conspiring with her mother in order to bring her down. However, she intended to find and kill Ursa in order to stop her from interfering with her plans to take the throne from Zuko.[18] In the end, however, she abandoned both of these goals once Zuko revealed that he would care for her unconditionally no matter what. Leaving Ursa alive and giving Zuko back the letter that could potentially oust him from the throne, Azula ran off from the remainder of the group.[19]\n" +
            "Abilities:\n" +
            "Azula was one of the most skilled firebenders of her time, recognized as a prodigy by both Ozai[11] and Zuko.[16] The most notable feature of Azula's bending was her ability to create blue flames, which are much more intense than the red, orange, and yellow flames normally used by firebenders, though she was only known to bend normal colored fire during her childhood.[11] Azula also used her flames in inventive ways, such as creating jets of flames,[25][26] whirling disks,[13] and blades of fire. She often firebent using only two fingers, rather than with a closed fist or open hand as was commonly used by other firebenders.[4] Also notable was her ability to produce a greater amount of flames than most firebenders without tiring, and she was able to maintain successive assaults for long durations of time.[13]\n" +
            "Azula demonstrated the ability to condense her flames, enabling her fire to cut clean through various objects. When formed into fireballs, the flames had a powerful concussive effect, able to firmly pulverize stone objects. She was also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames that could withstand the full force of four simultaneous elemental attacks (and a boomerang).[27] She was even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, something she used during her fight with Aang.[28] Azula was also capable of fighting off and defeating multiple Kyoshi Warriors, using both firebending and hand-to-hand techniques.[29]\n" +
            "The depth of Azula's potential was demonstrated in her use of advanced techniques, such as creating large blasts of flame, evaporating a wave of water that Katara threw at her, using her flames to propel herself forward like a jet, and minutes later producing and guiding lightning.[6] While she used her firebending less after returning home, she did demonstrate her abilities a few times, such as when she used her firebending to give extra propulsion to a kuai ball during a game, creating an explosion.[8] She also used her firebending to break free of her shackles and briefly attacked Sokka, Aang, and Toph.[7] Azula engaged in a pitched battle with Zuko and Sokka, where she was still able to battle on equal footing with them despite her being outnumbered.[26] In addition to creating her usual powerful fire balls, she was able to shoot her flames behind her in order to propel herself through the air onto the gondola.[26]\n" +
            "Azula was one of the most powerful firebenders of her time;[1][10] her firebending powers and prodigious skill allowed her to fend off many attackers with little effort and defeat a single talented bender like Aang.[6]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Azula was proficient in the highly difficult technique of creating and guiding lightning, a sub-skill of firebending, and was the first character within the series to demonstrate the ability.[22] She also displayed more fine control of this skill, performing minute flickers of lightning, which she used to both temporarily blind her brother Zuko and comically disarm Sokka of his boomerang on separate occasions. In turn, she could also produce large, compressed balls of lightning, as exemplified when she created such a ball to send away a swarm of moth wasps, who were attracted by the intense light.[18]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As Azula gradually lost her sanity prior to the arrival of Sozin's Comet, her firebending became unfocused and wild, which, combined with the Comet's empowering effects, made her all the more dangerous. However it also resulted in her becoming exhausted more easily than usual. Despite her state of mind, her attacks on Zuko and Katara during her final duel proved ferocious and destructive, and she was still able to fire lightning accurately.[1] However, her mental instability still weakened her battlefield prowess, and this ultimately resulted in her defeat at the hands of Katara. She displayed the ability to breathe fire as she struggled against her chains, but this was only brought about by her madness and rage in her defeat.[10]\n" +
            "Intelligence\n" +
            "Azula was an extremely intelligent and cunning strategist. She was also a highly studious girl. Since childhood, she was well-versed in her nation's military history as she successfully recounting Fire Lord Sozin's strategy in an old battle.[11] She planned a trap for Iroh and Zuko, which was only accidentally foiled by the captain of her ship.[22] She immediately discerned the Avatar's plan to mislead her with a false trail.[27] She also displayed incredible fighting prowess in learning the fighting styles of her foes, such as the sweeping wind kick ability displayed by Aang against her during the battle of the drill. She imitated it in the form of a sweeping fire kick during her battle with the Kyoshi warriors tending to Appa, utilizing that move to end her battle with Suki. With the Kyoshi warriors finally captured, Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai used their robes, stealing their identities to freely enter Ba Sing Se and the Earth King's palace, beginning her coup against the Earth King. This coup was single-handedly orchestrated by her, winning Ba Sing Se for the Fire Nation.[5][6] During the Day of Black Sun, she laid a trap for Aang and his friends using Dai Li agents in the Fire Lord's throne room, ensuring that the eclipse time would be used up.[7] She also displayed the ability to be so extremely capable of lying effectively that even Toph could not sense it regardless of how blatant the lie was, showing that Azula did not feel remorse for lying or many of her other actions.[7] She also displayed an ability to realize whether or not someone was telling the truth, stating simply that she was a person.\n" +
            "Even under the effects of her mental illness, her wit and ability to strategize were not completely lost, as she managed to use the after effects of chi blocking, which caused her body joints to become extremely flexible, to free herself from her restraints and from Zuko. On another occasion, she was able to save Team Avatar from a swarm of moth wasps by using a lightning ball to attract them due to the intense light.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Azula's intelligence made her very skillful in manipulating people. She used this skill on many subjects, including her brother Zuko,[6] her mother Ursa,[11] Long Feng,[5][6] the Dai Li,[5][6] Sokka,[7] and even her father to an extent.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Azula's high level skill in unarmed combat was displayed several times during the series. She easily avoided Zuko's frenzied knife attacks without the use of firebending, guiding his hands off course.[22] Later, she proceeded to disarm Suki and knocked her off her feet without bending.[29] She also had some skill with hidden weaponry, as she intended on using a shuriken knife during the eclipse.[7] Her acrobatics and use of a hidden shuriken knife were apparently skills she picked up from Ty Lee and Mai, respectively. Azula was very agile as she was able to run up walls and perform mid-air twirls. She dodged Aang and Toph's bending attacks with little to no effort using high jumps like Ty Lee, ultimately making Aang admit she was too fast to hit.[7] Her physical strength was also adept as she could perform a planche, supporting her body in a horizontal position just by using her arms, with little effort.\n";

Despite his desire to join his father, Sokka was not permitted to accompany the men on the mission and was left behind.[7] As there were no other teenage boys in the tribe, Sokka was the oldest male in the South Pole and, therefore, left as the leader of the tribe. He assumed responsibility for the tribe, haplessly training children to be future warriors, until his sister discovered an Air Nomad named Aang frozen in an iceberg.[7] When he learned that Aang was the Avatar,[8] he was at first skeptical that a child could really save the world. As he and his sister helped Aang on his quest, he began to believe that Aang really was the only hope for peace in the world.\n" +
            "Despite his inability to bend, Sokka became the strategist of the group, constantly trying to prove himself to be a great warrior like his father. He attempted to train the younger children of the Southern Water Tribe in fighting.

The earthbender grabbed Sokka and jumped from Appa as they both made their way to the academy. Sokka inquired Toph about her initiative to start the school, getting a response he identified as a lie and proceeded to guess her real motive. When they caught the metalbending students leaving the academy, Toph stopped them and introduced them to Sokka. The students informed their sifu that they had been kicked out of the school by Kunyo, whom Toph went to face and demand her school back. However, Sokka interrupted before they could fight, stating that it would be a better idea to give the place to the most effective school thus letting the students fight.

He began giving them a speech about metal and trying to make them bend metal coins, but unsuccessfully. After another disastrous attempt to inspire the three pupils by making them get emotional and scaring them with a metal monster Sokka made Toph bend, the earthbending instructor told her friend about her feeling of failure as she was expecting her students to become something they were not. The day of the battle, Sokka observed how Toph was surrendering at Kunyo and his students' arrival but was stopped by Ho Tun, Penga, and The Dark One, who demonstrated their ability to metalbend and defeated the firebending team with metal coins thrown by the Water Tribe warrior. He, impressed, congratulated the team for their successful result that lead to their final consolidation as metalbending students.[19]\n" +

She greeted Toph and Sokka, telling them that she had found them through a complaint from Kunyo about a \"dirt girl\" and a \"snow savage\" taking over his school. Suki climbed back into her balloon, explaining that she needed their help with preventing Zuko from starting another war. Landing the balloon near the Fire Nation battle procession, Sokka began to formulate their plan of action. On his command, Toph earthbent a tunnel that led to one of the tundra tanks. With the aid of the girl's metalbending abilities, the trio hijacked one of the tanks. Inside, Sokka decided upon their next move. He ordered Suki to pull up alongside as many tanks as she could, so Toph could loosen the screws on the tank's wheels with metalbending. When the Fire Nation Army reached Yu Dao, Suki drove their tundra tank to Aang and Katara, who were standing with the Avatar's Yu Dao fan club members outside the walls. Aang and his fans prepared to attack the tank, but stopped when Toph and Sokka clambered out of the machine. Sokka expressed his frustration at Katara and Aang for not coming back to get him like they had promised, and Toph explained that they had been trying to slow the Fire Nation Army down. When Katara questioned this, as the army had still reached Yu Dao, Sokka commanded Toph to put the next phase of their plan into action. The earthbender struck the ground, creating tremors that rendered the tundra tanks useless by causing the screws in the wheels to pop out. While the tanks had been disabled, Zuko ordered the rest of his soldiers to attack General How's. Aang and Katara retreated to the top of the wall, and Toph, Suki, and Sokka followed suit with the aid of Toph's bending, where they decided to split up. Sokka agreed to deal with Smellerbee and the rest of the protesters. After the battle was over, he was seen running back to Aang and Katara, rejoining Team Avatar.[20]\n" +

            "Katara waterbent a snowball at Sokka.\n" +
            "Some time after the battle for Yu Dao, Sokka attended a meeting together with his friends and several government officials at the home of the governor of Yu Dao to discuss the future of the city. A professor gave a lecture on ancient Earth Kingdom philosophies regarding the four nations, though it was of little interest to him. Sokka was complaining about it to Aang, who also could not be captivated by the professor. The two friends were soon shushed by Katara who did want to pay attention. Sokka retorted however, that he was not surprised that his \"boring sister\" liked \"boring lecture guy\", earning him a waterbending-generated snowball to the face from Katara.\n" +
            "Meanwhile, Zuko had snapped back to attention when the professor had made a comparison between how one treats their family and how one rules. He took the comment seriously, thus Sokka tried to lighten his mood by stating that the professor was a \"blowhard\", who was only liked by people like Katara, earning himself another snowball to the face.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "A week later, Sokka traveled to the Fire Nation Royal Palace together with Aang and Katara upon Zuko's inquiry. Upon arrival, they were delightfully surprised when they discovered Iroh there as well. Zuko explained that Iroh was there to act as interim Fire Lord while he would be gone, looking for Ursa, a journey on which he invited them all to accompany him. However, the amicable atmosphere quickly changed when Azula emerged from behind Zuko. Katara attacked the princess, with Aang and Sokka preparing to do the same. While Aang warned Azula to stay back as he did not want to hurt her, Sokka made it clear that he did not share the same sentiment, though his threat was met with laughter, as Azula did not perceive his boomerang as a danger. Before the conflict could escalate any further, they were halted by Suki and Ty Lee, who implored them to let Zuko explain the situation. While the Fire Lord did so, Sokka passionately reunited with Suki. As Zuko mentioned, however, that Azula was to come with them, Sokka called him out to be a \"bad decision lord\", though later complied regardless.\n" +

            "Sokka getting zapped by Azula\n" +
            "Sokka was zapped by Azula's lightning.\n" +
            "The following day, Sokka readily volunteered to take the first watch over Azula, much to Zuko's worry. He confidently walked over to the Fire Nation princess and threatened her again with his boomerang, though Azula shot the weapon out of his hands with a small lightning bolt, knocking him on his behind. As the princess was quickly overpowered by his friends and tensions calmed down again, he casually stated that it was perhaps better that someone else took the first watch instead of him.\n" +
            "Airborne, Sokka commented how the adventure felt like \"old times\", though much to his annoyance, Aang stated that it was better than old times since he could now kiss Katara whenever, something he deftly demonstrated. Aang suddenly had a gruesome expression on his face, caused by the presence of a spirit, causing Sokka to exclaim that it was already by enough that they had one passenger who stared \"with crazy eyes\" at them, referring to Azula who had a minor psychotic breakdown moments before. The Water Tribe warrior continued to mock the Avatar's expression, only to be stopped when Katara waterbent a snowball to his face. Their playful antics suddenly became serious when Azula dived off Appa and set fire to Aang's glider, who had swooped down to save her from plummeting to her death, subsequently sending him crashing down on the ground. As they landed, Sokka and Katara quickly jumped off to tend to the downed airbender, while Zuko went after his sister.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka, Katara, and Aang caught up with the two firebenders at a nearby river, right when they were about to fight one another. Katara cut the battle short, encasing Azula in ice. The princess subsequently insulted Katara, though froze in horror mid-sentence as the wolf spirit appeared behind an unknowing Sokka, as he thought Azula's fearful look was caused by his boomerang. Sokka nearly evaded getting his head bitten off by the spirit and ran to safety. When the spirit snapped at Aang who was trying to reason with it, Sokka threw his boomerang at the creature, though the full hit on its head did not even faze it. He was taken aback by the spirit's ability to swallow Zuko's fire blast, burp, and eventually throw up moth wasps, deeming the creature to be the \"grossest spirit ever\". The spirit insects attacked the group, covering Sokka's arm in such density that he could not even see it anymore. They were eventually saved when Azula shot a lightning bolt away from them all, drawing the moths and the wolf spirit with it.\n" +

            "Sokka lovingly covered Katara with a blanket.\n" +
            "At nightfall, the team had set up camp, and Sokka was sitting around the campfire together with Zuko, while Azula slept uneasily away from the group, Aang meditated, and Katara slept next to Appa with Momo. He questioned why Zuko let Azula sleep with her hands unbound, to which he received the response that he was giving her a chance, since she did save them all from the moth wasps. When Zuko asked why Sokka was still up, the Water Tribe warrior comically mentioned that he had bladder issues since he drank too much water to get rid of the moth wasps' taste. He looked over his shoulder at his sleeping sister and commented on the cold temperature, before getting up and lovingly covering Katara with a blanket. When a surprised Zuko asked why he would still care for Katara after she had thrown so many snowballs at his face, Sokka answered that he threw witticisms at her instead, stating that when it came to Katara, he did not mind getting the short end of the deal. He gave Zuko a blanket as well when the firebender requested one, before taking his leave to the forest in order to empty his bladder.[21]\n" +
            "The next day he had to help his sister put out fires started by Azula before heading into town. After watching a performance of Love amongst the Dragons the group was invited back to the director Noren's home for lunch. Sokka pretended they were a theater history group to help uncover more information about Ursa. Eventually questioning lead the group to the Forgetful Valley.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Upon arriving in the Forgotten Valley, Sokka noticed that there were faces on everything in the valley. When the group came under attack he did his best to defend his friends with his boomerang. Eventually they're attackers were revealed to be, Rafa and Misu, siblings from the Northern Water Tribe. After listening to their story he shared a moment with his sister.  When Aang went off to convince the wolf spirit to the pool, he helped Katara and Zuko subdue Azula, after she suffered another psychosis.\n" +

            "Empathising with his friend's sisterly problems, Sokka went with Zuko to assist him against Azula.\n" +
            "After the arrival of the Mother of Faces, he tried to prevent Azula's escape after she learned about her mother's new identity. He went after her, along with Zuko, taking a shortcut back to Noren's home. While Zuko went inside he stayed outside to defend the home. Eventually he ended up crashing through the roof of the home while battling Azula. After the battle he reunited with Katara and Aang, questioning Azula's motives for leaving the letter behind.\n" +
            "Visiting San's House of Seashells\n" +
            "Sometime later, Sokka and Suki visited Seashell San's House of Shells in a Fire Nation marketplace, telling Suki that he had wanted to collect seashells since he was a little boy. He compared the sounds in the shells to a \"teeny-tiny\" Aang airbending and asked San how much they were worth. Being told they were worth fifteen ban for one but at a special of two for thirty, he grew excited, but quickly realized what the vendor was doing and grew annoyed. Suki called the warrior a goof, but he asked if she meant \"handsome warrior with formidable biceps\". After a girl, Giya, entered the store and San discouraged her from buying shells because she appeared to be a fake collector, Suki confronted him and his assistant, Jojan. Sokka tried to warn the men to not put their hands on her, unfazed by the vendor's order for the couple to leave. As Suki began taking down the men, Sokka asked if she needed help; he was told sweetly she did not though was thanked for the offer and kissed on the cheek. After the men were defeated, the couple left, with Sokka warning them their shells had been set on fire by San's firebending because of the lacquer that was on them.\n" +
            "Sokka advises Giya\n" +
            "Sokka told Giya that she should not underestimate herself.\n" +
            "As the two exited, Sokka remarked that the store was not the coolest place ever. They caught up with Giya; after Suki introduced them to her, he added that she was a Kyoshi Warrior, confirming their status as the Fire Lord's elite guard. He told the worried girl that Suki could teach her self-defense techniques in the event that they were confronted again. After Suki told Giya the story of the Kyoshi Warriors' founding, Sokka told the seemingly unsure young woman not to underestimate herself. After being told that Giya would rather have some of her friends with her because she was too shy to train alone, the warrior smiled at his girlfriend. He later stood in with Giya and her friends as Suki began instructing them in the Kyoshi Warriors' ways.[22]\n" +
            "Reviving Yangchen's Festival\n" +
            "Sokka asks Yee-Li to try the turtleduck\n" +
            "Greatly enjoying the celebration banquet, Sokka raved about the turtle duck dish and tried to get the vegetarian Yee-Li to try it too.\n" +
            "When the peace talks in Yu Dao came to an end, Sokka and the rest of Team Avatar returned there to witness the introduction of the city's new coalition government. Although having witnessed a historic moment, he was more excited about the subsequent celebration banquet, during which he raved about the turtle duck dish, trying to get the vegetarian Yee-Li to try it too. When Toph informed everyone that her metalbending academy was doing so well that she was in need of expansion but lacked the necessary funds, Sokka suggested to charge her students tuition, figuring that she would end up being richer than the Earth King, though she rejected the idea. When Aang joined their table and announced that they were all going on a field trip the following day, Sokka was not immediately fond of the idea as he had hoped to peruse the local markets for a new bag.\n" +
            "Nevertheless, he accompanied Aang, Toph, Katara, and three Air Acolytes, Xing Ying, Yee-Li, and Jingbo toward a cliff overlooking the ocean where they would commence the celebration of Yangchen's Festival by bowing to a stone statue. Upon arrival, he was surprised to learn that it was not a statue of Yangchen as he had been expecting. When he asked Aang about the identity of the woman, the young Avatar had to admit that he was not sure who it was, but subsequently waved Sokka's skepticism about bowing to an unknown lady's statue away by stating that it was just how it was done.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph gives Sokka oogies\n" +
            "Sokka commented with disgust that seeing Toph's softer side gave him the \"oogies\".\n" +
            "After the bowing ceremony, the group set out toward the sacred meadow where they would enjoy a ceremonial Air Nomad meal, which was not something Sokka was looking forward to, giving that the Air Nomads were vegetarians. However, they soon discovered that a town had been built on the meadow and he and Toph set out to find a decent meal of meat. They later found the rest of the group on the grounds of the Earthen Fire Refinery, and after the factory's interim boss, Satoru, became starstruck by Toph and invited her for a tour of the refinery, Sokka and the others tagged along as Toph's guests. Sokka was amazed by the amount of machinery, as he had never seen so many before. When the tour led them back outside, Sokka's interest was piqued upon seeing a forklift and he insisted on trying it out for himself, though ended up breaking it. When Toph managed to fix the vehicle in mere moments, earning herself the praise of Satoru, Sokka commented with disgust that seeing Toph's softer side gave him the \"oogies\".\n" +
            "When Aang eventually managed to strike up a conversation with Satoru about the refinery's location and accused to factory of having defiled the sacred land, Sokka backed him up, stating that nature could never have polluted a river to the point the river nearby the factory had been defiled. However, when Toph corroborated Satoru's claim that the factory was not to blame for that, Sokka instantly changed his opinion, backing the earthbender up instead. When Toph subsequently got into an argument with Aang, the ground shook and Sokka urged the two earthbenders to remain calm, assuming they were responsible for it. When a second, bigger quake occurred, Satoru asked them all to leave, but before they could heed the engineer's request, they heard a factory worker call out for help, the earthquakes having left him trapped under a haywire machine. Sokka instantly helped usher the factory workers to safety under cover from Katara, who used her waterbending to pulverize incoming rocks, while Aang and Toph moved in to save the trapped man. After the crisis was averted, Sokka was shocked to learn that Loban's business partner and co-owner of the refinery was Lao Beifong, Toph's father[23] and called him out to be a liar when he declared Toph to be a confused girl, rather than his daughter.[24]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka and Katara run\n" +
            "Sokka used himself and Katara as decoys to lure the Rough Rhinos to the river side, where his sister would have the advantage.\n" +
            "When Lao subsequently ordered the Rough Rhinos to escort Team Avatar off the refinery's premises, Sokka was skeptical of the intention of the others to fight all the guards, noting that they all looked like strong men. He did not hesitate to help out, though, and used his machete to take a swing at Colonel Mongke. After the firebender deflected his blow on his chest plate and tried to blast him with fire, Sokka switched tactics and ran away. He dragged Katara, who was fighting two Rough Rhinos herself, along with him, prompting the three men to chase them. By dodging the charge at the last minute, Sokka had lured the guards to run down the fence and take to fight to the riverside, where he pointed Katara at the closeness of the water, which she used to quickly encase the Rough Rhinos in ice. Sokka approached Yeh-Lu, who was holding a burning grenade, and started to taunt him, taking his time to get rid of the explosive. He failed to extinguish the wick, however, leaving him to toss the explosive away. As it detonated near the river, Sokka angrily turned to Yeh-Lu, outing his unbelief over the destructive power of the explosive and that it had been intended to be used against him.\n" +
            "Kahchi attacks Sokka\n" +
            "Sokka was able to dodge Kahchi's attack, though the weapon destroyed one of the mine's support beams, causing the entire cave to collapse.\n" +
            "After Katara pointed Sokka's attention to the passageway the explosive had revealed, the siblings promptly checked it out. Using glowing crystals, they illuminated their path and eventually arrived to an iron ore mine, which was also the cause of the river's pollution. When they were discovered by Kahchi and Vachir, Sokka readied his machete and took out Kahchi. He had more trouble with Vachir, however, and the skirmish between them led to the weakening of one of the mine's support beams, as the ex-Yuyan Archer's arrows lodged itself deep in the wood, tearing it. After Katara pointed out the hazardous situation they were in, Sokka tried to urge every worker to evacuate, though without success. They were approached by Nutha and Niyok, who explained that everyone down there needed the job to survive, so no one dared to leave without their boss's orders. In order to get everyone out, Sokka ran back toward the refinery to find Lao Beifong and get him to order everyone to excavate the mine. He barged in to his office and explained the situation, though was met with disbelief, as Lao was not aware that the refinery was also excavating the iron ore. Sokka convinced Lao to follow him to the mine, where Lao gave the evacuation order. When Loban appeared and contradicted that order, Sokka was once more attacked by Kahchi. Although he was able to dodge the weapon thrown at him, the blade shattered one of the support beams, causing the mine to cave in. Being close to an exit, Sokka managed to exit the mine in time, supporting Niyok, who had broken her arm in the process. Outside, he found Aang and quickly explained the situation to him. Sokka was relieved to hear Katara call out to them after Aang reduced the amount of earth that separated them from the trapped people.[24]\n" +
            "Sokka picks Toph&#039;s students up\n" +
            "In order to save Toph and the others who were trapped in the mine, Sokka got Team Beifong to help him.\n" +
            "Arriving at the Beifong Metalbending Academy, Sokka quickly pulled Penga, Ho Tun, and The Dark One out of class, saying that it was a serious situation that he would explain more about en route, only noting at that point that Toph needed their help. After reaching the town, Sokka listened as the students told Aang about the situation being the reverse of an exercise surrounding iron plates and, hearing The Dark One use terminology such as \"messed up\" and \"stomped\", he asked what had happened to his poetry. The warrior watched as the metalbenders removed the ground above those trapped; while Aang and Katara kissed, Sokka told Momo, perched on his shoulder, that the oogies were well-deserved before happily reuniting with his sister.\n" +
            "After Aang returned from a short meditation session and explained that the town needed to be returned to its natural state, prompting Sokka to ask if that included the destruction of the refinery. With the iron mask the metalbender students had dug up being taken to the beaches by Loban and the Rough Rhinos, Sokka decided to join Satoru on his forklift to retrieve it at Aang's urging; he asked if he could drive, but was rebuffed by the scientist.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka and Satoru vs Loban\n" +
            "Sokka and Satoru ordered Loban to return the stolen mask to no avail.\n" +
            "Upon arrival at the beach, Sokka threw his boomerang at the rope the Rough Rhinos were using to drag the mask away, saying the Avatar needed it returned while preparing for an attack by Loban's lackeys. He used the weapon to stop an attack from Vachir before giving Satoru his battle club, telling him just to outthink his opponents. After deploying his boomerang to knock the bow and arrow out of Vachir's hands, he attempted to intimidate him by mocking his hand-to-hand fighting abilities. When the archer attempted to throw a punch, the warrior grabbed his wrist and flipped him to the ground. After noticing Satoru hit the forklift's engine to create a back blast and thus throw Kahchi back, Sokka commented that it was the proper way to outthink his foe. When Satoru asked if it worked on bigger opponents, Sokka's attention was called to the rising spirit, General Old Iron. As the spirit grabbed the mask with Loban by its ropes, Sokka and Satoru latched on and were dragged with him.\n" +
            "As the spirit marched to the town, Sokka, Satoru, and Loban were saved by Katara, who bent up a water vortex that allowed them to slide safely to the ground. Despite being rescued, Sokka only remarked that he did not like water slides any more than dirt slides.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Following Aang's victory over Old Iron, Sokka was running away from Momo, trying to keep some food he had been given. Three months later, during the new Spirits' Friendship Festival, Sokka set up a meat stand, selling items such as meat kebabs, which he described as a shish kebab but without the stuff consumers did not like.[25]\n" +

            "By the age of forty-three, Sokka served as the Southern Water Tribe representative on the United Republic Council as well as the Council's chairman. In his function as spokesman, Sokka sentenced Yakone, with consensus from the rest of the Council, to life in prison for his crimes. In response, Yakone bloodbent him and everyone else inside the City Hall courtroom.[12]\n" +
            "In 124 AG, Sokka wrote down the story of how he \"singlehandedly saved the world\" during the final stages of the Hundred Year War to include in a book that Aang was assembling for his son, Tenzin. In his letter, Sokka advised his nephew not to depend solely on airbending, since reflexes and strategy are equally important skills to develop.[26]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sometime after 128 AG, Sokka became a chieftain of the Southern Water Tribe. In 158 AG, a group of powerful benders known as the Red Lotus, led by Zaheer, a nonbender at the time, attempted to kidnap Korra, the new Avatar. Sokka, along with Zuko, Tenzin, and Korra's father, Tonraq, thwarted the kidnapping attempt and saved the young Avatar.[27]\n" +

            "\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "According to his sister Katara, Sokka was initially skeptical, abrasive, sexist and immature[7] and was always sharp-witted. Detached from Katara's and Aang's pursuit of the bending arts, he openly expressed his \"bender envy\".[11][29] Sokka thought bending was what got the world in trouble in the first place, so he believed only the skill and strength of ordinary men like himself could ultimately defeat the Fire Nation.[30] Not having bending abilities himself, Sokka instead preferred the ways of the warrior and the scientist.[31][32] He took his responsibility as protector seriously.[8] Initially, he did not seem to believe in the bending arts, calling Katara's bending \"magic water\".[7] The appearance of the Avatar seemed to change his mind. However, he never seemed to fully accept the fact that as the Avatar, Aang must learn firebending.[33] He was the least eager for Aang to start learning firebending under Jeong Jeong. Later on, when Aang accidentally burned Katara, Sokka threw him to the ground and yelled how he knew that Aang learning firebending was a mistake.[34] This antagonism toward firebending seemed to persist, evidenced when he jokingly referred to Zuko's training of Aang as, \"jerkbending\".[35] Apparently, Sokka only accepted the mastering of the last element because it would help Aang defeat the Fire Lord.\n" +
            "He could become serious when he desired to or when the need arose and was protective of his sister, Katara. This was shown when he violently tackled Aang to the ground after Aang accidentally burned Katara's hands.[36] Sokka was also protective of Aang, and when Aang surrendered himself to Zuko, Sokka immediately prepared to rescue him.[37] Later, he decided that getting Aang to the North Pole was more important than seeing his father again after years of separation.[38] Sokka also proved to be intelligent, creative, and good at coming up with ideas, even if said ideas were not always good. He was also generally the one who was counted on for determining the strategy of attack.[39]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka was clearly loyal to his friends, family, and allies. Many times over, he had helped them when he could and when he was needed.[15] However, Sokka also seemed to realize the importance â€“ and sometimes necessity â€“ of one having to fight their own battles. When Master Piandao attacked Sokka, Aang, Katara, and Toph rushed in to help him, but he told his friends to stay back as it was his battle to fight alone. He had to prove himself as a swordsman, although it turned out Piandao simply attacked his pupil just to test him.[11] Later, he held a similar view during Aang's battle with Ozai when Sozin's Comet arrived. When Suki suggested she, Toph, and Sokka should help Aang, Sokka pointed out that \"the Fire Lord is Aang's fight\". He understood it was Aang's destiny to face Ozai alone, while he, Suki, and Toph focused their energies on stopping the Fire Nation airship fleet.[17]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka&#039;s travel schedule\n" +
            "Sokka was the critical thinker of Team Avatar and devised the group's agenda.\n" +
            "Patriotic and long to hold a grudge, he strongly desired and eventually meted out vengeance for the Fire Nation's decimation of the Water Tribe and the death of his mother.[8] He held little interest in the mysticism surrounding bending and preferred to solve problems using his strength and his wits. He tended to be rash, however, and his pride often led to embarrassment. When Sokka had been humiliated, his versatility made for a heartfelt apology and changing of his ways. A good example of this was when he apologized to Suki and the Kyoshi Warriors for saying that boys were better than girls.[40]\n" +
            "Sokka learned to be flexible. He may have been closed-minded at first, but that was because he wanted to protect himself and those he loved. Not long after he started traveling with the Avatar, Sokka began to change, even to the extent that he humbly apologized to Suki.[40] As the series progressed, he became more optimistic. He liked to keep smiles on his friends' faces using his wit, sarcastic humor, and overall eccentricity. Sokka was an underdog. He was constantly the one who got beaten upon.[41] Most of his plans failed miserably;[42] however, he bravely kept fighting.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "From the start, Sokka was willing to die defending his tribe, even though he never stood the smallest chance.[8] Despite his obvious cleverness, Sokka sometimes acted silly, if not outright stupid. He occasionally created ridiculous plans that were nearly impossible to carry out. He was also a general victim of slapstick, often being sent flying or getting struck by things. Aunt Wu even stated, \"Your future is full of struggle and anguish. Most of it, self-inflicted\". When Sokka protested that she did not even read his palm, she remarked \"I don't need to. It's written all over your face\".[43] His sarcastic and strange behavior could sometimes carry over into important decisions.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka had a habit of over-explaining his plans, much to the annoyance of his friends.[44] He also had a habit of missing the point in certain situations, again much to the annoyance of his friends.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka looking goofy\n" +
            "As the main comic relief of Team Avatar, Sokka had a naturally lighthearted personality.\n" +
            "A passionate carnivore, Sokka had demonstrated his love of meat on multiple occasions and was the main hunter in the group.[43][45] Sokka also had a habit of using sarcasm. However, when he got trapped at one point, Sokka shouted at \"karma in the heavens\", vowing to give up both meat and sarcasm for assistance. He would also consider himself no longer \"Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy\", but willing to be \"Sokka, the veggies and straight-talk fellow\". However, when he was freed eventually, he had given up neither meat nor sarcasm. He even asked \"Aang, thank goodness, have you got any meat?\" after being found less than a second after shouting to Karma.[1] Despite his love of meat, he found it almost impossible to resist food, often gorging himself on various dishes when the group ate properly cooked meals.[40][46] He showed contempt for Katara's cooking, however.\n" +
            "As much as Sokka loved meat, he grew close to every pet he received. He had a hilarious relationship with Momo.[36] He also tried to adopt a messenger hawk, which he fondly named \"Hawky\".[47]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Perhaps the biggest growth and change in Sokka during his participation in the Hundred Year War was his learning to accept people of the Fire Nation, learning that no nation was entirely good or bad, meaning that he should not blame the people of the nation, but rather its ruler.[48][49][50]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka also appeared to be unbiased once he stopped judging girls. Despite Hama having been from the Southern Water Tribe like himself and his sister, a victim of War and the last true waterbender of their tribe, Sokka still did not exempt her from his suspicions as the probable cause of the strange disappearances. He also made no effort to prove her innocence when faced with absolute proof that she was behind them.[49]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka during the trial\n" +
            "Even in later years, Sokka maintained his humorous and good-natured personality as well as his sense of justice.\n" +
            "Under the tutelage of the swordmaster Piandao, Sokka expressed various unorthodox procedures while undergoing his training. In one exercise, when told to stamp his identity onto a sheet of paper, rather than simply writing his name, Sokka smeared ink all over his face and pressed it onto the paper. As he presented Sokka with his blade, Piandao related that it was not his skills that impressed him, but his creativity, versatility and intelligence. All were traits that went beyond mere skills and what defined a great swordsman.[11]\n" +
            "Sokka wrote with his right hand, but drew and ate with his left hand. He was possibly ambidextrous, because he was seen painting with his right[51] as well as his left[52] hand. His left-handed art was crude and rudimentary; however, this could just be due to a limited drawing ability.[52]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Sokka had a great ability to adapt: He changed where change was needed, learned to love and respect others, embraced his own identity, accepted failure, and formed lasting loyalties. He was willing to fight on, even when the cause seemed hopeless.[51][53] Sokka became a master swordsman, and a great warrior like his father.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "By the time he was forty-three years old, Sokka had mastered the art of public speaking; as chairman of the United Republic Council, he displayed an eloquence in speech and fluidity of presence he did not possess in his younger years.[12][54]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Abilities\n" +
            "Intelligence\n" +
            "Science and engineering\n" +
            "For an inhabitant of a world heavily supported by the mystic art of bending, Sokka showed a remarkable proclivity toward science. He was adept at creating weapons from a variety of materials, and learned how to construct amateur explosives from his father, which he once used to simulate firebending.[31] In another instance, Sokka used trickery and optical illusions to help his sister Katara fake the ability to earthbend.[55]\n" +
            "Sokka showed his incredible intellectual potential, capacity to learn, and critical thinking skills all throughout the friends' journey. He absorbed information quickly and completely and solved problems at an alarming rate. An example of this can be seen when he solved the dilemma of the hot air balloon, which stumped even an engineering genius, shortly after having the concept explained to him.[32]\n" +

            "Strategy and tactics\n" +
            "Sokka explains his plan\n" +
            "Sokka explained to Aang the new invasion plan.\n" +
            "As a nonbender among a group of master benders, Sokka was often overshadowed by the bending skills of his friends.[11][29] However, it was Sokka that usually devised plans,[39][56] gathered intelligence, and collected data[57] and maps[47] that could help his group defeat the Fire Nation. He often became the navigator and chose the route to follow despite the objections of others.[9] His skills as a fighter noticeably improved as the team's quest continued, although it was usually his persistence rather than skill that allowed him to land a blow against opponents of superior skill, such as Zuko[8] and Ty Lee.[29] Sokka employed other strategies to defeat larger enemies. He incapacitated Wan Shi Tong by using the element of surprise and attacking him from above. In that particular encounter, Sokka's wit succeeded where Aang and Katara's bending had failed. It was also Sokka who discovered that a solar eclipse disables a firebender's ability to bend and his idea to travel to Ba Sing Se and inform the Earth King.[57] When Ba Sing Se and the Earth Kingdom fell, Sokka devised a new invasion plan to strike the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun with a group of their friends and allies they had made, rather than Earth Kingdom's armies. On the day of Sozin's Comet, he came up with a strategy that allowed himself, Suki, and Toph to bring down the entire Fire Nation airship fleet. Perhaps his greatest triumph, however, was his nearly single-handed defeat of Combustion Man by using his boomerang to hit his tattoo on his forehead to block the latter's chi flow. This action ultimately resulted in Combustion Man's demise, something that the combined efforts of all his friends failed to do.[50]\n" +
            "Sokka's leadership skills evolved as the War ended. Initially, he assumed leadership of the group based on the fact that he was the oldest, that he had some rudimentary warrior training, and that Aang was just a goofy kid. However, his bossy attitude infuriated Katara.[58] His skills were also undermined by his xenophobia, chauvinism and general bullheadedness. However, Sokka was usually willing to admit when he was wrong. This seemed to earn him the respect of several of the people he met and helped him grow as a warrior and as a person. It should also be noted that Sokka was occasionally right in his opinions. His immaturity, though, often caused Katara and Aang to ignore him. By the second season, Sokka seemed to have matured and referred to the group as a team.[39] He also seemed to respect the opinions of others. They, in turn, considered his advice more seriously, even coming to rely on it.[39] Later, in the third season, the group told Sokka how much they needed him. Without him, they were bored, lost, unable to decide what to do, could not remember what they needed to do, and were being tortured by Katara's horrible jokes, to the point where Aang admitted, \"I guess the jokes don't run in the family\", much to her chagrin.[11]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Arts\n" +
            "Sokka showed a remarkable talent for poetry. When he stumbled into a poetry reading, he went toe-to-toe with the instructor in a haiku contest and held his own and nearly won. However, his hubris got the best of him, and he was viciously thrown out for accidentally adding an extra syllable to the end of a haiku, where he subsequently renounced his short-lived love for poetry.[2] Sokka was also, albeit humorously, a terrible artist, yet somehow strangely unaware or in denial of it. He emotionally defended his \"artwork\", which was still met with more laughter from his peers.[51][52]\n" +
            "Weapon proficiency\n" +
            "While training to be a soldier for the Southern Water Tribe, Sokka became proficient in a variety of weapons, the most noticeable being his trademark boomerang, with which he has shown impressive accuracy, even from a blindspot by determining the enemy's line of fire. His arsenal also included clubs,[8] a machete,[59] spears,[8] and a meteorite iron sword,[11] though he lost this during the battle at Wulong Forest defending himself and Toph from firebenders.[51]\n" +
            "Swordsmanship\n" +
            "Sokka&#039;s sword\n" +
            "Sokka was formally trained in swordmanship, revealing the serious side of his personality.\n" +
            "Wishing to contribute more to his team in actual combat, Sokka decided to learn the art of swordsmanship, wielding a Jian sword. Under the tutelage of the Fire Nation swordmaster Piandao, Sokka underwent various activities, including sparring matches with the butler Fat to hone his swordwielding skills and arts such as painting, calligraphy, and rock gardening to sharpen his mind. Eventually, when instructed to make his own sword, he used fragments of a meteorite that fell the night before to collect the metal needed to forge his blade.[11] Sokka's sword, like his master's, was patterned on a Qing Dynasty jian, but had the properties of the alien material used for its creation, making it unique. The blade retained an unusual all-black appearance and was able to slice through the toughest materials, such as steel.[54] Although Sokka proved unable to defeat his master in a duel, Piandao stated that Sokka possessed the traits that one day could make him an even greater swordsman than he was.[11] During the passing of Sozin's Comet, Sokka was once again able to prove his proficient skills in fighting.[53] Even after breaking his leg from a fall and holding onto Toph, who was about to fall to her death, he managed to take out two firebenders that were about to finish him off. He defeated them by drawing his boomerang and throwing it at the first firebender, knocking him out, and proceeding to kick his sword into the air, catching it and throwing it to slice through the platform on which the other firebender was standing. However, he lost both items in the process.[51]\n" +
            "More examples were present in his training with Piandao. Sokka became an advanced swordsman rapidly, besting Piandao's servant, Fat, in just a couple of days. He also managed to gain a firm grasp on blacksmithing in that short time, as he forged his own sword[11] and later a suit of armor for Appa.[33] His unique critical thinking ability came into play often through the training exercises of Piandao. He \"stamped his identity\" on a page by applying ink to his face and rolling it across the paper after he was informed that he got a little of it on him while thinking. During the rock gardening exercise, he \"manipulated the terrain to his advantage\" by rolling boulders and relocating moss to make a sort of lounge chair in the shade, thus appealing to his love of relaxation\n";

Born and raised in the Southern Water Tribe, where she mastered waterbending, earthbending, and firebending,[7] she later relocated to Republic City to attain a similar proficiency with airbending under the tutelage and guidance of Tenzin as well as overcome her aversion to the spiritual aspects of the bending arts. With the assistance of Aang's spirit, Korra gained the ability to energybend and after connecting with her past lives, she gained the capacity to enter the Avatar State at will, marking her transition into a fully realized Avatar.[8] Following the events of the Harmonic Convergence of 171 AG, she lost the capability to access her past lives.[9] After defeating Kuvira and bringing an end to the Earth Empire, Korra started a romantic relationship with her close friend, Asami Sato.[6][10]\n" +

            "Korra was born to Tonraq and Senna in the Southern Water Tribe following the death of Avatar Aang in 153 AG. At the age of four, Korra proudly introduced herself to the Order of the White Lotus by performing water, earth and firebending before them. A year later, Water Tribe Chief Unalaq came to learn that his own niece was the Avatar and constantly sought Tonraq's permission to train Korra in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe, which was actually a ruse to indoctrinate her in the ways of the Red Lotus and coerce her to reopen the long-dormant spirit portals to release Vaatu,[2] but his estranged brother shot down his offers. With this, Unalaq, who was secretly a member of the Red Lotus at the time, commissioned four of its members named Zaheer, Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li to kidnap her to train her in the ways of the organization. However, due to the efforts of Tonraq, Chief Sokka, Fire Lord Zuko, and Councilman Tenzin, the attempt was thwarted and the criminals were apprehended. After the incident, Tonraq and Tenzin, Korra's eventual airbending master, came to a decision to have the Avatar secluded in the Southern Water Tribe compound, away from the public eye as she pursued the bending arts.[11]\n" +
            "Over the next thirteen years, Korra demonstrated a prodigious talent which allowed her to quickly master the arts of waterbending, earthbending, and firebending, as she completed her training of the latter by 170 AG. During her youth, she met and tamed a female polar bear dog, whom she named Naga and who served as her animal companion.[12]\n" +

            "At the age of seventeen, Korra had mastered all the elements save for airbending, which she was set to be taught by Tenzin as soon as he moved to the Southern Water Tribe. However, after Tenzin's move to her home fell through, Korra took matters into her own hands and stowed away on a ship, traveling to Republic City. Roaming though the city in search of Air Temple Island, she discovered that the bustling metropolis was not all that she was told to be; she learned that there was a great deal of imbalance among its citizens with triads and Equalists running around. After defeating some members of the Triple Threat Triad, she found herself in trouble with Lin Beifong and her Metalbending Police Force. She was cleared of all charges due to Tenzin's intervention and eventually allowed to stay with him at the air temple to commence her airbending training there.[12] However, progress was slow and the Avatar grew frustrated. To unwind, she joined the Fire Ferrets pro-bending team and befriended her teammates, the brothers Mako and Bolin.[13]\n" +
            "When Bolin got kidnapped by the Equalists, Korra helped his brother to find him. They tracked him down to an abandoned warehouse where they witnessed firsthand Amon's ability to strip a bender of their bending abilities.[14] Although they managed to save Bolin, Amon left a deep impression on Korra, who grew fearsome of the Equalist leader. Regardless, she joined Councilman Tarrlok's task force.[15]\n" +

            "While she worked to rid the city of the Equalists, she also kept training with the bending brothers to win the Pro-bending Championship. Although they had some hard matches due to internal romantic struggles,[16] they managed to reach the finale. However, after their match against the White Falls Wolfbats ended with their defeat due to cheating of the other team, Amon and his Equalists attacked the Pro-bending Arena, effectively destroying the building.[17]\n" +
            "Soon after, Korra discovered that Hiroshi Sato had ties with the Equalists, and as such, she invited both Asami Sato and the bending brothers to come live with her at the island.[18] There, feeling insecure about herself as the Avatar, she and her friends formed a team with the purpose of patrolling the city and apprehending Equalists. As such, she angered Tarrlok, and the Councilman broke up their team by arresting all of Korra's friends. When she confronted Tarrlok about his actions later on, the discussion erupted into a duel. As the Avatar was about to overpower the councilman, Tarrlok revealed himself to be a bloodbender and subdued her with the ability.[19] Korra was locked up in a secluded cabin in the mountains surrounding the city. In isolation, unable to escape, she meditated and connected with Aang, discovering the truth about Tarrlok's heritage. However, when Amon and his Equalists ambushed the cabin, she managed to escape.[20]\n" +

Korra and her friends fought back for a while, but the sheer number and power of the Equalists forced them on the run. Korra retreated into the tunnel system of the city, where she would await the arrival of reinforcements in the form of General Iroh and his United Forces.[21] However, he too proved to be no match for the Equalists machines, and Korra pulled the injured general out of the water. After this incident, she vowed to take the battle to Amon, and together with Mako, she set out to confront him. After having learned that he truly was a waterbender from the Northern Water Tribe,[22] they eventually found him at the Pro-bending Arena, where he was holding a victory speech. The Avatar freed Tenzin and his children, though when she faced Amon, the Equalist leader managed to take away her bending. However, as she witnessed Amon on the verge of taking Mako's bending as well, she unlocked her airbending and managed to overpower Amon.\n" +

            "After the Equalists' defeat, Korra traveled to the Southern Water Tribe, hoping that Katara could undo Amon's action. The old healer was unable to, however, and a heartbroken Korra ran off to grieve on her own. There, she finally managed to connect with her spiritual side, and as such, Aang and the other previous Avatars helped to restore her bending, as well as bestow upon her the ability to restore other people's bending. Having regained her bending and mastered the Avatar State, Korra and Mako became a couple.[8]\n" +

However, after she learned there from her uncle, Unalaq, that it had been Tenzin and Tonraq's decision to keep her secluded in the compound, she broke with her airbending master and accepted Unalaq's offer to become her spiritual guide.[24] As a first step in her training, Korra journeyed to the South Pole an opened the Southern spirit portal, causing the spirit lights to return to the South. When they made their way back to the Southern Tribe, Korra discovered that in the meantime the Northern Navy had arrived and occupied the harbor.[25] Although Unalaq claimed it was an attempt to reconnect both tribes, the Southerners were not pleased with the Northern presence and Korra was forced to mediate between her own people, causing her to be seen as a traitor by some.\n" +

She thwarted the attempt and discovered Tonraq had nothing to do with the Southern Water Tribe rebels.[26] However, her parents were arrested and tried for treason nonetheless, a trial during which only her mother was acquitted. In an attempt to free her father, Korra confronted Judge Hotah and learned that the entire tribe and Tonraq's initial banishment of from the North had all been orchestrated by Unalaq. Enraged, Korra and her friends, with the help of Varrick, freed Tonraq and the other rebels from Northern custody, effectively commencing a Water Tribe Civil War.[27]\n" +

With tensions rising between the two tribes and the pressure to do something on Korra increased, she also began to have relationship troubles with Mako and, after he had informed Raiko of her plan to go to General Iroh behind his plan, they broke up. In a last attempt to gather support for her tribe, Korra left for the Fire Nation to ask the Fire Lord for help.

It was with Jinora's help, however, that she managed to cross over,[32] though soon after they arrived, the girls got separated. Korra found herself in a dark forest, where she reverted to her four-year-old self, though with the guidance of Iroh, she was able to revert the change. Making her way over to the spirit portals, she discovered that Jinora had been captured by Unalaq, who threatened to destroy the girl's soul if Korra did not open the Northern spirit portal as well. Korra complied, though as opposed to earning Jinora's freedom, she was attacked by Unalaq and dark spirits.

Although their initial attempt to breach through the Northern defenses at the portal ended up with their capture, the Team managed to escape due to Bumi's intervention. While Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi would look for Jinora, Mako and Bolin would hold Unalaq back while Korra closed the portals.

Traveling via the spirit lights toward Republic City, Korra engaged Unalaq, who had taken on enormous proportions as well and was laying siege to the city. During the fight, Korra searched the Dark Avatar for a sign of Raava, as she knew that dark could not live without light and upon the destruction of one spirit, it would always live on in the other. However, she could not find a trace of Raava and the Dark Avatar took advantage of her unguarded moment to trap Korra's soul within a spiritbending move. Right before Korra's spirit was on the verge of being corrupted, Jinora's spiritual projection appeared and revealed Raava within Unavaatu. Korra pulled the Light Spirit out, before employing spiritbending to purify Unalaq, destroying him. With Harmonic Convergence nearing its end, Korra, Raava, and Jinora returned to the Spirit World, where she and Raava fused back together as the convergence ended.\n" +

Additionally, the shift in the world's energy gave several people across the Earth Kingdom the ability to airbend.

            "Following him to the Misty Palms Oasis, the team discovered that Aiwei was meeting Zaheer at Xai Bau's Grove. In an attempt to follow them, they staked out Aiwei's room at the Misty Palms Inn, though eventually discovered that the grove was located in the Spirit World. Korra entered the Spirit World via mediation herself and found Aiwei being confronted by Zaheer. Zaheer promptly disposed of Aiwei by throwing him into the Fog of Lost Souls, leaving the two of them to talk. Being allowed to ask questions, Korra discovered that Zaheer and his associates were part of the Red Lotus, who desired to radically change the world by doing away with the separation of the four nations. Meanwhile, Korra's meditating form was taken by Asami on Naga, as Ghazan and Ming-Hua attempted to kidnap her. Although they managed to escape the Red Lotus, however, they were captured by Earth Kingdom soldiers, since the Earth Queen had declared them enemies of the kingdom.[2]\n" +
            "Korra and Asami captured\n" +
            "Korra and Asami were captured by the Earth Queen's forces.\n" +
            "Korra and Asami eventually managed to free themselves and prevent being taken back to Ba Sing Se. Their escape left them and the airship crew stranded in the Si Wong Desert, forcing them all to work together to reach the safety of the Misty Palms Oasis, where they once again met up with Mako, Bolin, Lin, Tonraq, and Zuko and learned that Zaheer had killed the Earth Queen[42] and threatened to do the same with the airbenders at the Northern Air Temple lest Korra surrendered herself to them.[43]\n" +
            "Their forces strengthened by Suyin and her security force, the team set course for the Northern Air Temple. On the way, Korra decided that she would give herself up, as it was the only way to save the airbenders. As such, she met Zaheer atop Laghima's Peak, while Asami, Mako, and Bolin would check on the airbenders at the temple, and Tonraq and the metalbenders would scale the mountain to be her back up. Zaheer double-crossed them, however, and despite P'Li's demise in the ensuing battle, he managed to escape with an unconscious Korra.[44]\n" +

            "Korra poisoned\n" +
            "Korra was poisoned in order to activate the Avatar State so the Red Lotus could end the Avatar Cycle.\n" +
            "When she woke up, Korra found herself suspended in chains in an underground prison hold and was administered a poison through her skin. She was told the poison would force her body into the Avatar State, enabling the Red Lotus to end the Avatar Cycle if they killed her in the Avatar State. She tried to fight it off, though she eventually succumbed to the poison's influence, and the Avatar State was triggered. The moment she remained in the state, she was attacked by Ghazan and Ming-Hua. Using her enhanced strength and bending abilities, she managed to free herself from her chains and confronted Zaheer in a duel, while Bolin and Mako took care of the others.\n" +
            "Korra suffocated\n" +
            "Defenseless, Korra was slowly suffocated by Zaheer.\n" +
            "With the Avatar State, Korra was able to hold her own against Zaheer, even force him on the defense, though she could not keep up battling both him and the poison, eventually succumbing to its effect. Rendered defenseless, Zaheer took the opportunity to suffocate her, though before he could finish his attack, they were both trapped in a tornado created by Jinora and the novice airbenders. Freed from Zaheer's hold, Korra managed to ensnare Zaheer and pull him down with her, enabling Lin and Suyin to trap him in an earthen prison. Despite her victory, Korra was left on the verge of death due to the poison within her. When Jinora recognized the poison to be a metallic solution, Suyin tried to bend it out of her, saving her life. However, the poison had taken a great toll on her, confining her to a wheelchair in a physically and emotionally weakened state.[45]\n" +
            "171 - 173 AG\n" +
            "After Jinora's ceremony, Korra changed into her normal attire and was set to board the steamship heading toward the Southern Water Tribe, together with her parents, Naga, and Kya. Before boarding, she was given a letter by Bolin, who expressed his delight over becoming pen pals with her. Although Asami inquired if she would be fine on her own as the business woman would be happy to accompany her, Korra declined the offer, stating that some weeks by herself to heal would do her good. Tenzin reassured her that he, Jinora, and the Air Nation would try their best to take care of things in her absence so she could focus all her energy on healing.\n" +
            "Senna worried about Korra\n" +
            "After another sleepless night, Korra agreed to her mother's request to visit Katara.\n" +
            "Three weeks later, while staying at the Southern Water Tribe Royal Palace, Korra had a nightmare about Zaheer asphyxiating her. She woke up, severely distressed and breathing heavily. Korra went out on the balcony for some fresh air and to look at the spirit lights, where she was found by her mother. Senna approached her, worried about her well-being, and urged her to seek help from Katara. She agreed and received a hug from her mother, who expressed her love for Korra.\n" +
            "While being healed by Katara, Korra was told that the mercury poison had caused considerable internal damage. Inquiring if the elder could fix it, Korra was told that her recovery was dependent on her own efforts, though Katara would help her guide her through. Korra expressed her desire to recover and was urged to visualize her big toe moving, a feat she managed to accomplish, much to her delight. Korra subsequently moved to the parallel bars in order to try walking. Leaning heavily on the bars, she managed to keep herself standing, though before she could take a step, she was overwhelmed by the memory of herself being poisoned by the Red Lotus, causing her to lose her balance and fall down. Although Katara comforted her, emphasizing that she was safe there and urging her to use her mind to overcome her pain, Korra refused to try again, declaring herself done for that day. Throughout her stay in the South, Korra received and read the letters sent to her by Asami, Mako, and Bolin.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Katara helping Korra\n" +
            "Korra worked intensively with Katara to help speed up her recuperation from the mercury poisoning.\n" +
            "Korra kept up her intensive physiotherapy training, though nearly six months later, she lost patience due to a lack of significant progress. Lamenting about her inability to take more than a few steps without collapsing, she snapped at Katara in her frustration over being dependent on others for everything, while her friends were helping the world and the elderly woman could not heal her. Immediately realizing that she should not have addressed Katara that way, she apologized and was told to let go of her anger and frustration. Upon admitting that she was tired of her situation and the senselessness of it all, Katara tried to comfort her by sharing the sense of loss Aang felt over losing his entire culture and telling her he had tried to find meaning in the suffering and eventually even succeeded to find peace. When Korra asked what she would find, she was offered the response that whatever it was, it would be interesting to find out. Korra subsequently tried to walk again with the aid of the parallel bars and managed to walk the short distance toward Naga, falling happily against the polar bear dog's chest.\n" +
            "Tenzin and a frustrated Korra\n" +
            "Although she had improved greatly, Korra grew frustrated that she had not recovered completely and began to fear that she may never do so.\n" +
            "Korra continued to improve and by the time Tenzin arrived at the Southern Water Tribe compound, Korra had improved to the point where she could once again run around and fight. As the airbending master climbed off Oogi, she warmly embraced him, exclaiming how much she had missed him. Upon receiving the compliment that she looked great, she dragged Tenzin off toward the training grounds, eager to show him how much she had improved. She sparred against three firebenders and although she started strong, she was knocked down after she was once again overcome with a vision of Zaheer flying down upon her. Helped back to her feet by Tenzin who declared the sparring match to be over, she angrily stated that she believed she had been ready. As Tenzin tried to put her at ease by pointing out that there was no shame in taking the time needed to make a full recovery as her duties as the Avatar could wait, Korra asked about the Earth Kingdom, since she knew it was still in chaos. Hearing that the situation had been stabilized by Kuvira, she grew sad, stating that the metalbender was doing her job. Before Tenzin could tell her that she merely needed to be patient, Korra glared at him, threatening that if he would voice the thought, she would \"water-smack\" him in the mouth. Frustrated about the situation, she left the sparring ring.\n" +
            "Korra writes Asami\n" +
            "Korra confided in Asami about all her fears regarding her recovering via a letter.\n" +
            "For two years, Korra continued her training and recovery at the Southern Water Tribe. At one point, she wrote a letter back to Asami, in which she apologized for not having written before. She revealed that the past couple of years had been the hardest of her life and even though she had recovered physically, she still could not enter the Avatar State and was often plagued by memories of Zaheer and the Red Lotus attack. She admitted that she worried that she might never fully recover, despite her best efforts. Korra implored Asami to not inform Mako and Bolin about the letter, as she did not want to hurt their feelings and felt like they would not understand her as opposed to Asami.\n" +
            "While having a meal with her parents, an absent-minded Korra was playing with her food until her mother's inquiry about her well-being snapped her out of her thought. She expressed her desire to return to Republic City, hoping that it could speed up her recovery due to it being the place of action and where her friends were. Korra declined Tonraq's offer to get the White Lotus to prepare for her departure, insisting on going alone as it would give her the chance to clear her head.\n" +

            "Korra cutting her hair\n" +
            "Wanting to start over and rediscover herself, Korra shed her Water Tribe identifiers, donned an Earth Kingdom attire, and cut her hair.\n" +
            "En route, Korra briefly stopped at a beachside village to purchase supplies. Upon requesting the local fishmonger for two lobster crabs, she was recognized as the Avatar and asked to pose for a picture, just like Avatar Aang had done decades before. The man's ramblings about Avatars were cut short when another vendor shouted about a robbery in progress and the fishmonger pushed Korra to intervene. Although she intercepted the thieves, the two men easily defeated her, leaving Korra lying on the beach in shame. Korra eventually made it to Republic City, though as she neared Air Temple Island, she saw herself in the Avatar State standing atop one of the rocks near the island, glaring menacingly at her. Realizing she was not ready to return, she turned her boat and left Yue Bay, docking somewhere in a deserted area, where she obtained Earth Kingdom clothes, shed all her Water Tribe identifiers, and cut her hair.\n" +
            "Korra with spirits\n" +
            "Convinced that she needed to discover how to reconnect with Raava on her own, Korra declined the help of the spirits.\n" +
            "Korra traveled to the Spirit World through the northern spirit portal and made her way to the Tree of Time. Her meditation in the hollow of the tree was interrupted by chattering spirits, who were debating among themselves whether or not she was the Avatar. When Korra verified her identity as such, she revealed to them that she had been away for a while due to sustaining severe injuries in her last big battle, which had left her unable to contact Raava. She admitted to meditating in the Tree of Time since the last time she had done so, it had shown her a myriad of images and she had hoped it would be the case again, figuring it could help her to reconnect with Raava and access the Avatar State. When it proved to be unsuccessful, she declined the spirits' help, deciding that she needed to figure it all out on her own since the help of others had not borne any fruit so far.\n" +
            "In order to keep people from worrying about her, Korra wrote letters to her parents, telling them she was pleased to have returned to Air Temple Island and see her friends again. In reality, however, Korra was roaming the physical world by herself, crossing icy seas, hiking up volcanoes, and traversing the desert, all the while seeing an apparition of herself in the Avatar State. While she was wandering the desert, Korra saw Raava atop a nearby dune, though by the time she had scampered to the top, the Light Spirit was gone, having been only a mirage.[46]\n" +

            "Korra confronting herself\n" +
            "Still suffering from the mental whiplash of the mercury poisoning, Korra was haunted by visions of her Avatar self attacking her.\n" +
            "Six months after having left the South Pole, Korra made her way to a small Earth Kingdom town at night, where she was once again haunted by her Avatar apparition. Determined to end the haunting, Korra confronted the apparition, though lost.[47] When she encountered a puppy in the middle of the road, she decided to follow the dog after it had chased away her apparition and ended up at the Foggy Swamp. Losing track of the animal who turned out to be the light spirit whom she had met at the Tree of Time, she was once again attacked by her apparition, who dragged her down in a hallucinatory pool of mercury. She eventually woke up in the home of Toph Beifong, who had found her unconscious in the mud.[46]\n" +
            "Korra bends mercury\n" +
            "Letting go of her fears of her past enemies, Korra was able to bend the mercury out of her body, relieving her mental block.\n" +
            "Desiring to get back into Avatar fighting shape, Korra asked Toph for help and eventually learned that she was still carrying around traces of mercury. When she was plagued by another vision of Zaheer trying to asphyxiate her in the Avatar State as Toph tried to remove the mercury, Korra was told that she would have to bend the metal out herself, since she was subconsciously fighting Toph's attempts to remove it out of fear of getting injured again.[48] When Korra made her way through the swamp two days later, she was haunted by visions of her old enemies once again, though with Toph's help, she figured out that she needed to face her fears and stop fighting her old enemies if she ever wished to be able to deal with future threats. In order to speed up her recovery, Toph took her to the banyan-grove tree, where she reconnected with herself and the world. After being found by Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo, they all returned to Toph's dwelling in the swamp, where Korra eventually managed to bend out all of the residual poison out of her system.[49]\n" +
            "Kuvira versus Korra\n" +
            "Still not in top form and plagued by hallucinations, Korra was overpowered by Kuvira.\n" +
            "In order to let Kuvira and the rest of the world know that the Avatar was back, Korra and the three airbenders traded the swamp for Zaofu, though they discovered that the military of the Earth Empire was already camped at its gates. Believing that conflict had only made things worse in the past, Korra set out to negotiate with Kuvira though was urged to convince Suyin to give the city up. Upon her return to the city, Korra learned that Suyin had left with Wei and Wing to sneak into Kuvira's camp and deal with the threat themselves.[50] When Kuvira announced over the city's communication system that Suyin and the twins had been captured, Korra tried to reason with the army commander though ended up being challenged for a one-on-one duel for the fate of Zaofu. Kuvira had the upper hand until Korra entered the Avatar State. On the verge of ending Kuvira, however, she was plagued by another hallucination of herself in the Avatar State, allowing the army commander to recover and defeat her. As Kuvira moved to kill her, she was saved by Jinora and Opal and escaped from Zaofu with them, Ikki, and Meelo.[51]\n" +
            "Team Avatar excludes Wu\n" +
            "Moving past the tension, Korra shared a warm hug with Mako and Asami, truly reuniting as a team.\n" +
            "Returning to Republic City, Korra met up with Asami and Mako, though there reunion soon became tense due to their three-year separation. When Prince Wu was kidnapped, the trio gave chase, tracking the royal down to a train departing from Central City Station. Despite the team's continuous bickering, they found Wu and freed him, though were soon after forced on the defense by several Earth Empire agents. Working together, however, they managed to hold them off and escape. The three friends made amends before Mako retreated to the Sato estate with Wu, and Korra and Asami returned to Air Temple Island.[52] As Korra mulled over her past experiences, she became doubtful over her abilities as the Avatar, though with the support of Asami and Tenzin, she became once again determined to restore balance in the world.[1]\n" +
            "Zaheer helping Korra\n" +
            "With no other options left to her, Korra agreed to let Zaheer guide her into the Spirit World and help her to let go of her fear of \"what might have been\".\n" +
            "When Jinora asked for her and Opal's help to search for Ryu, who had gone missing with his tour group in the Spirit Wilds, Korra discovered via the plants that Kuvira was harvesting roots from the Foggy Swamp. Splitting for Jinora, she left to warn the world leaders about the impending danger, though she was soon contacted by Jinora again, who called for help as she was being attacked by the vines. With Mako's help, Korra discovered that Jinora, Ryu, and the other tourists' souls had been trapped in the Spirit World, though after failing to meditate in, being blocked again by Zaheer's memory, she concluded that she needed to face the Red Lotus leader. When Zaheer noted that her spiritual block was a conscious choice, Korra snapped at him for having created the \"worst dictator the Earth Kingdom [had] ever seen\", which lead Zaheer to offer to guide her into the Spirit World. Although Korra initially refused his help, she let him guide her through her traumatic experience, and she managed to make it into the Spirit World, where Raava's spirit lit up within her. Together, they found and rescued the trapped souls.[53]\n" +
            "Baatar Jr. and Korra\n" +
            "Korra managed to force Baatar Jr. to try to talk Kuvira out of conquering the United Republic of Nations by threatening to keep them apart forever, which was something he could not live with.\n" +
            "To help the United Republic prepare for battle, Korra asked the spirits to help defend their new home, though they refused to take part in human wars.[54] When she later learned that Kuvira's attack was imminent, Korra and Team Avatar set out to destroy the train tracks with which they presumed Kuvira would transport her spirit energy cannon to Republic City. Much to her shock, however, she discovered that Kuvira was already nearing the city and had mounted the weapon on an enormous mecha suit instead. While the Earth Empire military forced the United Forces to surrender, Korra formed an airbender stealth team and kidnapped Baatar Jr. in order to force him to try and talk Kuvira out of conquering the United Republic of Nations. The plan failed, however, and then were nearly all killed when she blew up the Future Industries factory in which they were hiding.[55]\n" +
            "Korra saving Kuvira\n" +
            "Risking her own life, Korra bent the beam from the spirit energy cannon to save Kuvira.\n" +
            "While it was decided that Asami and Varrick, with the help of Hiroshi and Zhu Li, would adjust the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits in order to cut through platinum, Korra and the other benders faced Kuvira's enormous mecha suit in an attempt to slow it down. After Asami and Hiroshi managed to cut a hole in the suit, which cost Hiroshi his life, Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, and Suyin infiltrated the mecha suit.[56] While Lin and Suyin took down the cannon, which ended up being discarded in the Spirit Wilds, Korra faced Kuvira, though their battle was interrupted when Mako and Bolin caused the engine to explode. The two women continued their fight inside the Spirit Wilds, where Kuvira fired the spirit energy cannon at Korra. Although she dove out of the way of the beam, the cannon charged itself with the surrounding spirit vines and overloaded. When the beam threatened to kill Kuvira, Korra jumped in front of her and, entering the Avatar State, held the beam at bay, though the enormous surge of energy expanded around them and exploded, creating a new spirit portal.\n" +
            "Korra sympathizes with Kuvira\n" +
            "Korra understood and sympathized with Kuvira's reasoning for her actions.\n" +
            "Korra and Kuvira were thrown into the Spirit World. Seeing her opportunity, Korra explained that she saw a lot of herself in Kuvira, stating that they were both fierce and determined to succeed, sometimes even without thinking things through. When the metalbender snapped that she had been merely trying to help her people in the absence of the Avatar, Korra understood that Kuvira had only been trying to create a place where she and her people would never have to feel vulnerable again and sympathized with the hardships that come from a life as an orphan. She managed to convince Kuvira to surrender, and when they both exited the Spirit World via the portal, Kuvira gave herself up to Lin and Suyin, acknowledging that the Avatar had saved her life and possessed a power beyond what she could ever hope to achieve.\n" +

            "Korra and Asami held hands and gazed at each other lovingly as they entered the spirit portal, beginning their romantic relationship.\n" +
            "Later, Korra attended Varrick and Zhu Li's wedding at Air Temple Island, during which she learned that Wu planned to abolish the earth monarchy and establish independent states with democratically elected governments akin to the United Republic of Nations instead, a cause for which she pledged her support. When Korra later distanced herself from the party and gazed over the skyline of Republic City, she was joined by Tenzin. Talking about how much she had already changed the world and how much more she desired to do, they were eventually interrupted by Asami, and Tenzin left the two women to themselves. Korra apologized to Asami for having been absent for three years and tried to comfort her for the loss of her father. When Asami stated that she did not feel like returning to the party and could use a vacation, Korra offered to go with her anywhere she wanted. The two decided to journey to the Spirit World and, upon stepping into the spirit portal, they turned to each other and held both hands while gazing lovingly into each other's eyes, starting their romantic relationship together.[6][10]\n" +
            "Legacy\n" +
            "By 174 AG, Republic City Park had been renamed Avatar Korra Park in commemoration of Korra's acts of heroism and a statue of her was erected there as well.[47]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "Korra ready to fight\n" +
            "Fiery and pugnacious, Korra was quick to pick a fight upon her first moments in Republic City.\n" +
            "On the surface, Korra is fierce, independent, and pugnacious, but beneath her tough exterior, she possesses a strong loyalty toward her friends and duty as the Avatar. She also has an admirable compassion and devotion, demonstrated when she expresses love toward things such as her family and friends. Her offensive battle style means that she is always quick to initiate or rise to a challenge, and is similarly quick witted and impulsive, especially in heated situations. As an \"Avatar-in-training\", she lacked perception toward the damage her bending is capable of, and her rash decisions often resulted in her accidentally insulting others.\n" +
            "True to Korra's character, Lin once stated to Tenzin that it was \"hard to believe [his] sweet-tempered father was reincarnated into that girl\".[17] Her personality is, in many ways, the opposite of her past life's; Aang was a peaceful, diffident, nomadic airbender, whereas Korra is tough, impatient, headstrong, sarcastic, and assertive. She has a habit of getting close-up to people when confronting them, sometimes grabbing them by the chin when trying to get her point across. Additionally, while Aang was initially reluctant to be the Avatar, to the point where he ran away to prevent his responsibilities as the Avatar from disturbing his life, Korra fully embraced her position as the Avatar from a young age, reveling in its power. However, similar to Aang, she also has a good sense of humor and enthusiasm, and a vulnerable teenage charm.[57]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Korra looking smug\n" +
            "Fully embracing her position as the Avatar from a young age, Korra is tough, impatient, headstrong, sarcastic, and assertive.\n" +
            "Being initially unable to connect with her spiritual side proved to be a stumbling block in Korra's training, and she admitted that her personality is the opposite of the typical airbender's; as Tenzin noted, Avatars tend to struggle with the bending art most opposite their personality.[13] Due to the lack of a spiritual center in her life, Korra is impulsive and therefore has a hard time hiding her true feelings; this could be seen in her reaction to learning that Asami Sato was Mako's date during the gala Tarrlok threw in her honor, where she immediately expressed her jealousy by being rather hostile toward Asami and short with Mako.[15]\n" +
            "Due to her concentration on the physical side of bending, Korra was initially quite worried when she saw \"the revelation\" of Amon's true abilities during his demonstration,[14] a fear which expressed itself in Amon's words in the nightmare she had soon afterward, \"Once I take your bending away, you will be nothing.\" This and her later encounter with Amon revealed this fear.[15] She tried repressing these fears for the good of Republic City when she joined Tarrlok's task force, but had trouble staying her usual upbeat self and became rather reclusive,[15] and eventually made the rash decision to call Amon out in a one-on-one duel. This indicates that she is ruled by her emotions even when she tries to pretend they do not exist, leaving her vulnerable to Amon as shown by the results of the said encounter.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Korra challenging\n" +
            "Refusing to admit her fear, Korra challenged Amon to battle.\n" +
            "Like her immediate predecessor Aang, Korra places a high priority on her position as the Avatar, despite their different approaches. Although at first Aang was uncomfortable with having to use outright violence to bring balance to the world, he eventually developed an unrelenting determination toward following his age-old destiny. Korra, on the other hand, takes a non-conformist stance over her Avatar training. For instance, after trying out pro-bending, she stated to Tenzin that the reason why she had been unable to airbend was because the Avatar no longer needed it and was instead meant to focus on modern styles of fighting. Tenzin quickly stamped her proposal out as preposterous, reminding her that the Avatar is destined to master all four elements at all costs.[13]\n" +
            "Upon learning that she was kept locked away from the world by Tonraq and Tenzin, Korra became quite irate toward them, being hostile whenever they tried to speak with her.[24] Korra expressed more hostility for her father after learning about his past in the Northern Water Tribe.[25] However, when she found out that Tonraq was not involved with an effort to overthrow Unalaq, she forgave him quickly.[27] Korra has no qualms intimidating or threatening whomever has offended her friends and loved ones, as exemplified when she struck fear to the Equalist protester to find out Bolin's whereabouts,[14] and when she threatened to feed Judge Hotah to Naga if he would not comply to her wishes.[28] After learning the truth about her father's banishment, Korra developed an animosity toward Unalaq, which caused her to dismiss him as her spiritual mentor. Once she realized that Unalaq had been using her to try to free Vaatu from his prison in the Spirit World, her animosity toward her uncle increased in intensity.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After learning the origins of the Avatar Spirit through the life of Avatar Wan and regaining her memories, Korra became more patient and humble, as exemplified when she thanked Tenzin for his undying loyalty to her.[32]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After the Harmonic Convergence, Korra demonstrated a more patient demeanor yet still retained her impulsive nature. This is evident when she tried to physically force Ryu, an airbending slacker, into becoming a part of the new Air Nation against his will, with Mako and Bolin eventually forced to drag Korra out to stop the mayhem.[38]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Korra&#039;s fire breath\n" +
            "Believing Zaheer had killed her father, Korra firebent at him in rage.\n" +
            "Korra's temper and rage, once provoked, could border on murderous, as during her captivity by the Red Lotus and still believing that Zaheer had killed her father, Korra declared that she would be free and none of the Red Lotus would survive. She fully intended to kill Zaheer, showing her righteous fury, but with a dark and wrathful side to her as well.[45]\n" +
            "After barely surviving her encounter with Zaheer and having the poison removed from her system, Korra was placed in a wheelchair during her recovery, which left her traumatized and in a state of depression. She still showed compassion and pride for her friends throughout, however, and was present when Jinora received her airbending tattoos, crying during the ceremony.[45] In the following years, she struggled to recover, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and being haunted by flashbacks to her encounter with Zaheer. Although she recovered physically, her emotional struggle led her to embark on a journey to reconnect with her Avatar Spirit while hiding her identity as the Avatar, going against her tendency of being prideful about it.[46] After an elderly Toph helped her to face and overcome her fears of her past enemies, Korra bent the residual mercury out of her body and regained the ability to enter the Avatar State,[49] though it was not until she faced Zaheer in person and was helped by him to accept what had happened to her and release her fear of \"what might have been\" that she was able to fully reconnect with Raava.[53]\n" +

            "As the Avatar, Korra has the unique ability to use all four elements, and has the potential to become the most powerful bender in the world. Furthermore, since she was a child, Korra has always had a remarkable affinity for the physical aspect of bending. She also quickly took to the three different styles of pro-bending with simple instructions from her teammates, greatly impressing them after only a week of training to ultimately become a highly capable member of the Fire Ferrets. While in the Avatar State, Korra is able to use an air spout to raise herself into the air while unleashing all four elements in rapid succession. Later after more training, Korra becomes able to easily enter this form with complete control, even during intense competition.\n" +

            "Korra's waterbending abilities manifested at a young age, before she had even been recognized as the Avatar by the Order of the White Lotus. Subsequently trained formally in the art for over a decade by Katara, Korra has demonstrated a high level of skill in this art in addition to its various techniques. She is capable of creating large walls of ice, powerful water whips,[12] and water waves strong enough to push back and, when frozen, contain an enormous mecha suit standing over twenty-five stories tall.[56] She can also launch herself high into the air and maintain the height on a gigantic waterspout easily, fight off several aerial attacks with various water attacks, and propel herself plus another person through the water at high-speeds to avoid attacks. She used her waterbending abilities to procure herself a spot on the Fire Ferrets pro-bending team, referring to herself as a \"top-notch waterbender\". While she was taught Northern and Southern style waterbending, which both employ fluid motions, Korra has quickly adapted to Republic City's more aggressive, straightforward waterbending style.[13] Korra is also able to draw a sufficient supply of water from the air for her bending.[36] Korra also has sufficient knowledge of bloodbending to fully understand the nature of its application, despite having never used the outlawed skill.\n" +

            "Korra healed Bolin following a pro-bending match.\n" +
            "During her waterbending training, Korra was also taught the advanced skill of healing. As Katara was well-regarded as the best healer in the world, Korra herself became highly skilled in the art, something she takes pride in.[16] By using a small supply of water as a catalyst on the targeted area, Korra is able to drastically increase the healing rate of injuries. Korra's skills were great enough to quickly soothe away the pain on Bolin's injured arm,[16] and mitigate the severe burns on General Iroh's arm, leaving no trace of scars.[22]\n" +
            "Despite her short time studying under her uncle Unalaq, a spiritual expert, Korra managed to learn his technique of spiritbending, which involves changing negative energy into positive energy in spirits in order to pacify them.[29] While she only managed to understand the mechanics in the beginning, Korra eventually successfully performed the technique and was able to calm countless small spirits at once.[32] She was even able to use the technique to destroy Unalaq and purify the dark spirit Vaatu when the two were fused together as the Dark Avatar. Following her uncle's death, Korra became the only known living practitioner of the skill.[9]\n" +

            "Korra threatened Tarrlok through exhibiting her earthbending prowess.\n" +
            "Korra's earthbending abilities also manifested at an early age. Spending many years of intense training, Korra has gained great mastery in this art. While regularly using traditional earthbending tactics in combat, she quickly learned the basics of pro-style earthbending from Bolin, able to attack more akin to a firebender with light footwork and quick jabs. Her prowess is great enough to easily take control of earth targets levitated by other earthbenders. She has demonstrated her adept skill and ability in earthbending on several occasions, notably launching a member of the Triple Threat Triad several stories into the air. Korra's earthbending is also able to affect a considerable radius, upturning and demolishing everything in the area. As seen when pairing with Bolin, Korra is able to effectively synchronize her earthbending with another person to increase the versatility and control of her target.\n" +

            "Korra used metalbending to rip through the top of a truck.\n" +
            "During Korra's stay at Zaofu, Suyin Beifong offered to train her in the art of metalbending. Suyin started Korra on a meteorite as a beginner and she quickly adjusted to the metallic body and learned to mold it into various forms. As such, she became the first Avatar to learn metalbending.[40] Korra quickly became more versed in metalbending, being able to skillfully wield metal cables with great dexterity and fluidity in her movements and ensnare her opponents, even more experienced metalbenders, with the said cables. She can also tear through a large, thick metal wall obstructing her path, albeit with some difficulty as she is still somewhat new to this skill.[41] Korra's control eventually became of such a level that she was able to remove residual traces of mercury out of her own body[49] and could easily pry open the roof of vehicles.[52]\n" +

            "Korra defending herself\n" +
            "Korra displayed her firebending during her test.\n" +
            "As with earth and water, fire also manifested at a young age. Due to the fact that she relies on offensive maneuvers when under pressure, Korra mostly uses fire in combat. Her firebending training was finished when she passed the test impressively at the age of seventeen, having learned various advanced techniques such as the breath of fire. Against other firebenders, she can easily deflect and disperse the enemies' attack. Her control is so fine, she is able to produce a small yet intense flame at her fingers that she can maintain to melt through metal chains. She can likewise produce daggers in each hand for close-range combat. She can propel herself through the air with firebending in short bursts, and use these bursts to run along a wall. Contrary to the usual difficulty an Avatar has with learning the opposite of his/her native element, firebending has become second nature to her. Korra tends to utilize firebending when provoked, frustrated, or attempting to assert dominance, such as when she falls back on firebending a newspaper cut out of Lin after failing to do so with airbending. Tenzin attributed this unusual combination to her innate personality being quite fit for the art thanks to her natural assertiveness and fiery spirit.[12]\n" +
            "Airbending\n" +
            "Korra discovering her airbending\n" +
            "Upon discovering her ability to airbend, Korra successfully saved Mako and defeated Amon.\n" +
            "Unlike the prior three elements, airbending did not come easily to Korra. Tenzin explained that it was due to its innate nature of being the most opposite to her personality. While initially having difficulty with airbending's fighting style and battle tactics, during her first pro-bending match, she was able to employ basic airbending movements to dodge the opposing team's assault and ultimately tire them out to win the match for her team.[13] As her training has progressed, her understanding of its moveset greatly improved, and she was able to quickly and gracefully progress through the gates and ultimately learned all of its physical maneuvers;[14][19] she later applied these tactics against the Lieutenant, effectively dodging all his attacks.[17]\n" +
            "After Amon severed Korra's connection to her first three elements and was about to take Mako's firebending, Korra's emotional build up allowed her to fully connect with her spiritual side to utilize airbending. Despite only knowing the theory and practice of its forms, Korra has shown considerable skill and power in airbending: being able to create air blasts from punching and kicking movements, which were strong enough to send Amon flying several yards through a window. Although she has shown great power in her offensive use of airbending, her style of airbending varies dramatically from other airbenders, employing straightforward offensive movements similar to firebending while lacking the more characteristic circular and spiraling movements. Six months after the Anti-bending Revolution, she has nearly mastered the art, employing traditional maneuvers, such as gliding, and is able to proficiently use several advanced skills, such as the air scooter. After learning from Jinora, Korra became able to separate her spirit in astral form and travel to the Spirit World through meditation. Ultimately, air has become Korra's second most used element and she is confident enough in her prowess to at least teach the basics to other airbenders.\n" +

            "Korra used energybending to restore Lin Beifong's earthbending abilities.\n" +
            "Upon connecting with her past lives for the first time, Avatar Aang restored Korra's bending abilities and bestowed her with the knowledge of energybending. Although never having used it herself before, she was able to freely restore a person's bending, as she did so with Lin Beifong's earthbending.[8] Following the Anti-bending Revolution, Korra extensively used energybending to restore the bending of those benders whom Amon victimized with his bending severing bloodbending technique, except for a few who used their bending for crime, such as Shady Shin.[23]\n" +
            "Korra is also capable of using energybending to connect with her own inner spirit, giving her access to the cosmic energy of the universe, creating a giant astral projection of herself. In this form, she can unleash energy blasts from her chest that can overpower the Dark Avatar's in a direct clash. Although disconnected from her physical body, Korra remained capable of waterbending.[9]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After Raava made her aware that when she was in the Spirit World, she was connected to all the spiritual energy, Korra realized that she was capable of bending that energy, with or without her physical body. As such, she was able to release trapped souls from a vegetative pod after she had meditated into the Spirit World[53] and divert a beam powered by spirit energy in the physical world.[10]\n" +

            "In addition to bending, Korra also has considerable physical prowess. Her impressive raw strength allows her to easily lift Tenzin and his children at the same time, or a grown man with one arm.[12][14][55] Likewise, she can easily leap across long distances and over high obstacles from a stationary position, as well as effectively traverse various terrains and vertical surfaces with great speed to hoist herself easily up and off rooftops. She can easily throw a much larger and heavier opponent against a set of pipes with enough force to break them,[13] and can shatter large chunks of ice launched at her with a single punch each. She is also capable of swimming across large bodies of water.\n" +
            "Korra is also quite fast and agile with sharp reflexes, able to easily dodge a much larger opponent's assault in a narrow area or a metalbender's launched cable from close-range. Her dexterity and balance are also considerably high, allowing her to skillfully dodge a large barrage of projectiles nearly unscathed, further aiding her in battle. She has impressive acrobatic skills akin to parkour and free-running; she can slide across surfaces with great control, perform mid-air flips and twirls, run up and across walls. She is also quite flexible, able to bend and twist effectively enough to attack from various angles or squeeze through most spaces. Korra can also be quite precise in her attacks, detaining several skilled Southern waterbenders without inflicting any major injuries.[26]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Korra is also a highly proficient unarmed fighter, able to knock out opponents with a single kick, simultaneously dodge an attack while sweep-kicking the enemy's legs, and once subdued a man using only Mako's scarf. Even against an expert weapons-wielder like the Lieutenant, Korra skillfully parried and countered his close-range assault. Furthermore, with a combination of bending attacks, she was able to create openings and land powerful physical blows, ultimately defeating him. Even without her bending, she was able to defeat several chi blockers before being rescued by Naga.[36]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Korra also has keen instincts under pressure, demonstrating capable tactical and escape skills, such as using her armband as an insulator against the Lieutenant's electrical assault, and faking unconsciousness in order to catch the Equalists by surprise.[20] Her resilience is also considerably high as she is one of few who canceled and broke free from a bloodbending grip, albeit with some difficulty.[8]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Korra is also an eloquent public speaker. She was initially nervous when she had to speak in her first press conference in Republic City.[12] During the gala, Korra's brashness got the best of her after being pitted against a group of reporters, haphazardly giving empty threats to Amon to cover up her fear of him.[15] Over time, Korra became more confident and composed when it was required of her to speak publicly, considering her words before saying them. This was exemplified when she declared the independence of the Southern Water Tribe and her decision to keep the spirit portals open.[9]\n" +

            "As the Avatar, Korra also has the capacity to act as a bridge between mortal world and the Spirit World, the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. Despite this, Korra had always struggled with the spiritual aspects of being the Avatar, initially being unable to connect with her past lives or enter the Spirit World on her own.[12] As her training under Tenzin progressed, she had slowly begun to connect with her spiritual side, seeing visions of her past life as Aang. Later, after her encounter with Amon, all of her active bending abilities were taken away, but this allowed her to finally break free from her airbending block and defeat Amon. Upon sinking into despair after Katara was unable to restore her lost bending, Korra was finally able to connect with her past lives, which restored all her bending abilities, as well as passing on to her the ability to energybend. With her newfound spirituality, she can enter and leave the Avatar State at will.\n" +

            "After being attacked by a dark spirit, Korra was forced to undertake a spiritual journey to rediscover herself. She ultimately gained a deeper connection with the Avatar Spirit and her past lives, all the way to the original Avatar, Wan. With this strengthened connection, Korra is able to purify dark spirits by balancing the energy within them, as well as access various memories from her past lives, including Avatar Aang's memory of Iroh and Toph, and Avatar Wan's memory of his personal teapot. Following the events of the Harmonic Convergence in 171 AG, Korra lost her connection to her past lives by being temporarily separated from Raava, who was destroyed. Due to some residual traces of mercury in her body after her battle with Zaheer, Korra lost the ability to contact Raava and was unable to enter the Avatar State for three years. However, after she bent the remaining mercury out of herself in 174 AG, restoring her power to enter the Avatar State, though it was only after facing Zaheer and releasing her fear of him and the near death experience she suffered that she was able to contact Raava again.[49][53] She also learned to connect to people's energy via spirit vines.\n";

Tenzin inherited most of his father's mementos prior to his father's death.[8]\n" +

They were able to defeat and apprehend the criminals and imprison them in four separate and specially-designed prisons that would neutralize their combative abilities.

Both parties soon became frustrated, however, as they often clashed about the reasons for Korra's inability to airbend and about how the teenage girl should spend her free time.[14]\n" +
            "After Korra returned from an Equalist rally and stated how Amon had succeeded in taking away someone's bending ability, Tenzin stated that the revolution was more dangerous than ever.[15] As a council member, Tenzin tried his best to avoid anti-nonbender measures to be taken, though he was unable to prevent Tarrlok from forming his task force to attack Amon head-on.

When Korra learned that Tenzin was partially behind the decision for her to grow up in the secluded Southern Water Tribe compound, her relationship with him became strained. When the airbending master failed to subdue a dark spirit, Korra accepted Unalaq as her spiritual mentor in Tenzin's place.

She began considering whether she had made a mistake in leaving the portals open, but Tenzin consoled her, telling her that her fulfilling her duties as the Avatar would not please everybody. Bolin soon arrived and informed them that the new airbender had turned up on the city bridge. After Korra rescued the airbender, Tenzin offered to train him.[28]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Tenzin solicits for airbenders\n" +
            "With the emergence of new airbenders, Tenzin desperately attempted to recruit them to rebuild the Air Nation.\n" +
            "The next day, Asami brought in an airship for Team Avatar to use to search for more airbenders. However, everywhere they went, none of the new airbenders seemed interested in leaving their previous lives and training at the Northern Air Temple. Bolin suggested that they put up a circus act at the next town, and the group succeeded in drawing out an orphaned airbender boy named Kai. Just as they accepted Kai into their group, the local sheriff and his deputies arrived and revealed that Kai was in fact a thief who had stolen his adoptive family's life savings. The sheriff intended to put Kai in prison; however, in exchange for returning the life savings to Kai's family, Korra convinced Tenzin to accept Kai as his ward to turn over a new leaf with Team Avatar.[29]\n" +
            "In Ba Sing Se\n" +
            "As the group neared Ba Sing Se, Korra asked Tenzin about the Earth Queen, to which the airbender replied that he had not met her, but heard that she could be demanding. Upon arriving, the group was personally greeted by Grand Secretariat Gun, who led them to their guest house while giving a lengthy list of rules for interacting with the queen. Shortly after they settled into the house, they realized that Kai was missing. As the others wondered if he was even worth searching for, Tenzin argued that despite the boy's shortcomings, he was still their first recruit and they could not lose him.[30]\n" +
            "Mako talks about Lake Laogai\n" +
            "Tenzin discussed the possible whereabouts of the missing airbenders along with the other members of Team Avatar.\n" +
            "Two days later, Tenzin learned from Korra that the queen, Hou-Ting, had been conscripting the city's airbenders into her army. Like the rest of the group, Tenzin glared at Bumi after he suggested that the queen had a right to do so. Mako suggested that the airbenders could have been held under Lake Laogai, and Jinora told her father and the group that she could still use her spiritual projection to get underneath the lake, much to Tenzin's shock.\n" +
            "Team Avatar made their way to Lake Laogai and, before his daughter began her meditation, Tenzin advised her to return to her mortal body if anything were to go wrong. When she returned, she informed Tenzin and Korra that nothing was down there. The airbending master was left frustrated, realizing that the Dai Li could be holding the airbenders anywhere in the city. When Korra suggested that Jinora and Kai had a connection, Tenzin wondered what that could mean as Jinora attempted to meditate and reach locate Kai again.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After Jinora discovered that the airbenders were being held under the Earth Queen's Temple, the team reconvened at their home, with Tenzin believing they needed to free them that night. When they heard a knock at the door, Tenzin opened it, and was shocked to see that it was Lin who had dropped by. The police chief informed them that Korra was in danger and needed to leave Ba Sing Se due to the escape of Zaheer and his allies. When Korra asked who these people were, Tenzin answered by telling her of the criminals' kidnapping attempt, subsequent imprisonment, and why he and Tonraq placed her in the training compound. The Avatar refused to leave however, instead desiring to continue with Tenzin's plan to free the airbenders, which Lin agreed to join.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Team Avatar ambushes guards\n" +
            "Tenzin and the members of Team Avatar ambushed two Royal Earthbender Guards to infiltrate the Earth Queen's Temple.\n" +
            "That night, Team Avatar infiltrated the Earth Queen's Temple, easily defeating two Royal Earthbender Guards. Once underground, the group split up, with Tenzin, Bumi, and Korra going to free the majority of the airbenders after advising the other half to radio them if anything went wrong. When Tenzin and Korra entered the airbenders' barracks, they wondered what the two were doing there, with Tenzin trying to calm them down and informing them that they were being freed. They watched as the benders left the barracks, Tenzin assuring one of them that Kai was also going to be released. Soon, they all found their way above ground, and began to make their escape. However, they soon found themselves surrounded by Dai Li agents and the Earth Queen, who ordered the agents to attack the group when Korra refused to turn the airbenders over. Tenzin joined in the effort to hold off the agents as Lin's police airship made its way overhead and the benders fled to it. Tenzin and Korra soon worked to blast Dai Li agents off the scaffolding of the temple as the airship made its way away from it with the airbenders in tow. Upon seeing Oogi, the master airbender whistled for his companion, and he and Korra propelled themselves onto the bison's saddle. Shortly thereafter, the other members of the team, including Kai, launched to the flying bison with Bolin's earthbending, enabling a full escape of the city.\n" +
            "The morning after, Tenzin offered the airbenders either safe refuge or relocation to the Northern Air Temple to learn the ways of the Air Nomads. Much to his happiness, they all chose the latter option. Before he left, Tenzin assured Korra that she was making friends and had done well before embracing her. He soon departed for the air temple aboard Asami's Future Industries airship.[9] Settled in, Tenzin messaged Kya at Air Temple Island, informing her that he was with a group of airbenders at the Northern Air Temple and wished for his family and the Republic City airbenders to join them there.[31]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Training the new airbenders\n" +
            "Tenzin annoyed\n" +
            "Tenzin grew frustrated with his class of new airbenders, as none of them, save for the Air Acolyte Otaku, showed any interest in Air Nomad history and even Jinora had to laugh at Bumi's distraction.\n" +
            "At the Northern Air Temple, Tenzin tried telling the new airbenders about the tale of Monk Tang Xu's legendary fast, but to his dismay, only one airbender, Otaku, showed any interest in the lesson. He tried to ask the group which island the fasting took place on, but only Otaku knew the answer. As he tried to continue with the lesson, he found his teachings mocked by Bumi, inciting laughter among the class and, to the master's further frustration, Jinora. Tenzin was able to catch the group's attention by riding around on Oogi and performing tricks, though warned an excited Kai that they needed years of training, in addition to there not being enough bison for them. After they saw a herd of the animals, Tenzin further cautioned them that they were wild and would again require years of training to tame.\n" +
            "Tenzin being informed\n" +
            "Tenzin was informed by Kya and Pema about Zaheer's infiltration at Air Temple Island.\n" +
            "Before he could continue his lesson, however, Ikki, Meelo, Pema, and Kya arrived with the airbenders from Air Temple Island, and Tenzin dismissed his class in annoyance, as he noticed that they were all distracted by their anxiousness to see them. Meeting up with his family, he asked his wife and sister how things were in the city and was informed by the former about Zaheer's infiltration of Air Temple Island. He was assured that everyone was all right although Zaheer managed to escape and take the locket of Guru Laghima with him. After he helped Kya with the correct pronunciation of the guru's name, she expressed her confusion regarding all the gurus, and Tenzin grew annoyed when she inquired if he remembered the \"long and boring\" story of the guru who never ate, gruffly saying that he recalled it. Their conversation was cut short, however, when Tenzin was called away by an Air Acolyte who informed him that Korra was calling on the temple's radio.\n" +
            "Tenzin asked Korra if everything was all right and where they were; he found out they were in Zaofu and that Lin's half-sister, Suyin, had an airbending daughter, Opal, who would be headed his way, much to his pleasure. He was briefly left with an awkward feeling, however, when Bolin jumped on and fawned over Opal. Once Korra regained control, she asked him how the training was going. The airbender expressed his disappointment over the students' lack of interest in the training. At her suggestion of letting Bumi help out because of his military command experience, he was baffled, noting that he believed him to be his worst student. Once she explained about his enjoyment of organizing and how he could trick his brother into thinking it was all his idea, Tenzin agreed and called her wise.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Bumi advising Tenzin\n" +
            "Following Korra's advice, Tenzin asked Bumi for advice on how to motivate the new airbenders.\n" +
            "Tenzin approached Bumi for leadership advice. His brother advised him that he would need military discipline: he must break them down and build them back up, rule them with an iron fist, and show them who the master was. Tenzin thanked him and, the next morning, followed up on his advice. He woke the airbenders at dawn with a large blast from a horn before leading them on an exhausting ten-mile hike, but he kept them pushing onward to meditation lessons, saying the chilled group could warm themselves with their breathing. He promptly dismissed Bumi's concerns, going right into meditation.\n" +
            "The airbender followed up by leading them to a training area for a balancing exercise. He demonstrated the proper form by shooting up onto a small post on one leg, explaining they would need to maintain their connection with heaven and earth while balancing like a feather in the air. He ordered them to stay on the posts and concentrate; when Bumi fell, Tenzin got in his face and told him to get right up, asking him angrily if he could not handle it while calling him a soldier. He assured a concerned Jinora that they would be able to take it, while advising Otaku, who was covered in lemurs, to keep concentrating.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Tenzin yelling at Bumi\n" +
            "Now following Bumi's advice, Tenzin started teaching with an iron fist, yelling at his students and dismissing their complaints.\n" +
            "Later, he shaved Daw's head while explaining that, with one's head shaved, an airbender could feel the wind around them. As the rest of the group showed some reluctance to shave their heads, Tenzin was quick to elaborate that they did not need to as it was a personal choice, much to Daw's surprise, who had not been aware of the fact that he had had the option to refuse. When no one else opted to have a haircut, Tenzin moved them right on to the obstacle course. He was warned by his daughter that he was pushing too hard, but again assured her all was under control before walking away. As the students attempted the course, he advised them that airbenders needed to move like the wind. While they crossed a field of cacti, he stated they would need to stay on their feet. Once everyone except Bumi had made it up, Tenzin warned his brother that failing to complete the course in thirty seconds would mean everyone would have to run it again. After Bumi fell, Tenzin told him to get right back on the wall, prompting the retired commander to quit out of anger. Tenzin dismissed him, saying they did not need his attitude. Upon several complaints from the other recruits, he snapped at them and told Jinora to take over, telling her she was the master and to lead them through basic exercises. Jinora wondered when she could get her tattoos, the idea having been brought to her by Kai, but the master snapped again, believing Kai had no knowledge of when one got their tattoos. He told her she was still a little girl and thus could not get them, but his daughter snapped back and walked away. Tenzin subsequently told Ikki and Meelo to lead them through the Ba Gua circle.\n" +
            "Tenzin retired to a small room for meditation, muttering in frustration about his daughter's and Bumi's actions while trying to focus. When Pema approached him, he lamented over his apparent failure while wondering why they could not understand his goals. His wife reminded him that were not necessarily Air Nomads, while telling him about her first worrisome night as an Air Acolyte, though Tenzin said the hard beds she had to lie on were better for one's back. This only served to annoy her, and Tenzin promptly apologized. His wife continued, recalling her need to adjust and advising him to be patient as they dealt with the same. Tenzin came to a realization about his attitude, particularly toward Korra, before thanking his wife and kissing her on the cheek.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Returning to where Bumi and the airbenders were gathered, Tenzin apologized to his brother for losing his patience, but Bumi told him he was not talking to him and walked away. The master tried to tell him to get back there, but just sighed and wondered where Jinora was. He was told that she left with her \"boyfriend\" on her glider, whom he recognized as Kai.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Searching for Jinora atop Oogi, Tenzin soon spotted a truck riding around the mountain. Upon hearing a cry for help from his daughter toward Kai, Tenzin took action, directing his bison toward the ground. He rammed the truck from the side with Oogi before rescuing Kai. After Kai began attacking the truck's driver, who was the head of a gang of bison rustlers, Tenzin stopped him, advising his student that an airbender did not attack a defenseless foe, but complemented him on his technique.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Tenzin and Bumi reconcile\n" +
            "Tenzin apologized to Bumi for yelling at him and emphasized that he truly was a part of the Air Nation.\n" +
            "That evening, with the bison retrieved and the rustlers captured, Tenzin expressed his pride in Bumi; his connection with the spirits and natural leadership reminded him of their father. The master accepted his brother's apology for being a problem and assured him he was truly a member of the Air Nation. Afterward, he approached Jinora and Kai, telling the two that the bison recognized them to be of their own kind because the animals were the original airbenders. He hugged Jinora, expressing their luck that no one was hurt. He also realized that he had been too hard on his daughter; while unable to believe she could be old enough to earn her tattoos, he promised her he would think about it. Upon watching as the baby bison began to fly, he stated that everyone was growing up.[32]\n" +
            "Ambushed by the Red Lotus\n" +
            "Tenzin and his family cornered\n" +
            "Tenzin, his family, and the other airbenders were rounded up in the Northern Air Temple's courtyard to be used as leverage by the Red Lotus to get to Korra.\n" +
            "Sometime later, Tenzin was tending to baby bison when Meelo retrieved him as Korra was calling on the radio from Zaofu. He was warned that Zaheer was on his way to the Northern Air Temple, but upon receiving the message, he noticed the Red Lotus had already arrived. When questioned by Meelo what was happening, he told his son just to stay close as they flew to the courtyard on their gliders. Tenzin found Bumi with a group of airbenders and told his brother to gather up the rest of the benders, get to the bison stables, and evacuate. As he, Pema, and their children tried to leave, they were confronted by Zaheer and gathered, along with the rest of the airbenders, in a courtyard. There, the master asked Zaheer what they wanted from them, only to be told the Red Lotus wanted nothing, which prompted him to ask why they came at all. Upon the criminal telling him he wanted Korra, Tenzin realized he and the airbenders were being used as leverage. Declaring he would not let his foe get to Korra, Tenzin attacked Zaheer, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua with a powerful gust of air before telling Jinora to lead the airbenders out while asking Kya and Bumi to help him hold the Red Lotus off. After nearly being impacted by a combustion beam from P'Li, he warned everyone to stay out of her line of sight.\n" +
            "Wounded Tenzin\n" +
            "A battle-weary Tenzin declared that he would rather die than let the Red Lotus get to Korra.\n" +
            "Tenzin dueled with Zaheer and went on the offensive, pursuing him up the courtyard walls and firing several blasts of air as he chased Zaheer up the temple and toward the cliff. At a temple's ledge, he briefly knocked the criminal airbender down and dodged counterattacks. Soon after, Zaheer lunged over him and attempted to attack from behind, but Tenzin fought it off and continued to duel along a walkway. The master was able to knock down his foe again while turning on his back, but just as he was about to finish off Zaheer, P'Li shot a combustion beam at the cliff, sending Tenzin flying; he was, however, able to break his fall with airbending. As he recovered, he was hit with shots of water and earth from Ming-Hua and Ghazan, knocking him down. He tried to get back up and defend himself, but was overwhelmed by his foes and knocked down again. Rising a third time, he blasted Zaheer and Ghazan away with airbending and managed to defend against Ming-Hua, but was blasted to a wall by P'Li. Surrounded, badly injured, and barely able to rise, Tenzin nonetheless refused to yield, saying it was not over as long as he was still breathing. He tried another air blast at Zaheer, but it was dodged; he was instead hit by Zaheer in return. Soon, the master found himself relentlessly being attacked by Zaheer, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua.[33]\n" +
            "Escaping the air temple\n" +
            "Asami supporting Tenzin\n" +
            "After being released by Asami, Tenzin was held up by the industrialist.\n" +
            "Tenzin was taken to a small room in the temple and chained to the floor, where he was found by Mako, Bolin, and Asami, who had come to retrieve the airbenders under the terms of Korra and Zaheer's deal. Upon Korra's surrender to the Red Lotus, Bolin and Asami worked to try and free him, only to soon realize the Red Lotus had double-crossed Team Avatar. While the brothers tried to hold Ghazan and Ming-Hua, Asami continued to try and release him, asking him where the airbenders were, to which he replied he did not know as Zaheer moved them out of the temple. Ghazan began using his lavabending to destroy the temple as Tenzin was freed through Asami's hair pins. With the exit blocked off and lava quickly surrounding them, the airbending master informed the team that Oogi and the other bison had been scared away, but let them know of a secret passage out, telling Bolin to bend through a back wall.\n" +
            "The group made their way up the stairs to a meditation room with Mako and Asami supporting Tenzin while Bolin tried to block the lava flow. He pointed them to a door which led to a secret stairwell out of the temple, but on the way down, the hot liquid rapidly approached them. With them unable to outrun it, Bolin tried bending out rocks along the side of the stairwell, but this only led them to the edge of the mountain with nowhere to go as the lava approached them. Bolin, however, was able to bend the lava back and cease its flow, with Tenzin remarking it was incredible. Kai soon approached them on his baby bison, Lefty, much to the master's happiness. The group hopped aboard Lefty and flew away from the collapsing temple; Tenzin watched briefly in sadness as it fell apart.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Kai and Team Avatar\n" +
            "Kai told Tenzin and Team Avatar about the airbenders' probable location.\n" +
            "After meeting up with Lin, Suyin, Tonraq, and members of the Metal Clan, Tenzin was held up by Mako and Lin, asking if Zaheer had escaped with Korra; he was told that was the case and that Zaheer had unlocked flight, much to his shock. He told them about Guru Laghima's rumored ability to fly, but had never believed it to be true. Upon saying they needed to find the airbenders, Kai told them he knew where they were, prompting Tenzin to ask of there whereabouts and how he found them. The younger airbender told him he had seen them being transported by P'Li to a series of caves, where the captives were taken by Red Lotus guards. Unsure of how they could reach them, Tenzin soon spotted Oogi returning and patted his head, glad to see him again. He rode on his bison, along with several others except Kai, to the caves in question.[34]\n" +
            "Reunion and rescue of Korra\n" +
            "After reaching the caves, Tenzin was helped off Oogi by Tonraq and Bolin. He told them to find the airbenders and his family, to which Suyin assured him they would not leave without them. While he watched Korra and Zaheer duel, his family approached him with Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo rushing to hug him, saying he was glad they were all right while assuring Pema he would be fine. He watched as everyone else emerged before continuing to view the duel in the skies. When Bumi asked how Zaheer could fly, Tenzin explained the criminal had unlocked airbending powers that had not existed for thousands of years. He soon played spectator as Jinora rallied up the airbenders to create a tornado to save Korra from Zaheer's grasp and also as Suyin saved the Avatar by extracting a metallic poisonous substance from her body.[35]\n" +
            "Anointing Jinora\n" +
            "Two weeks later and fully recovered, Tenzin returned to Air Temple Island with his family, joining them, the Beifong sisters, Korra's family, Zuko, and Raiko as Asami wheeled the debilitated Avatar out to them. He told her she was looking stronger every day. He assured a concerned Raiko she would be fine, needing time to heal from the effects of the poison, though pondered who could protect the world as the Avatar healed.\n" +
            "Jinora hugs Tenzin\n" +
            "Tenzin was embraced by Jinora after he officially anointed her an airbending master.\n" +
            "At Jinora's ceremony, Tenzin expressed his pride in her, praising her for never giving up hope and demonstrating leadership when the fate of the Air Nation and the Avatar hung in the balance. He stated the future was bright and praised Korra as well for opening the portals and reviving the nation in addition to her willingness to lay down her life for them. He announced that, while she recuperated, the Air Nation would return to its nomadic roots but would serve people of all nations to help restore balance and peace. He vowed to Korra they would follow in their footsteps and bring harmony to the world before revealing Jinora's master tattoos, declaring his daughter would lead them in their new path. As the ceremony reached its conclusion, Tenzin was embraced by Jinora.[35]\n" +
            "Tenzin and a frustrated Korra\n" +
            "Tenzin tried to console a frustrated Korra, though had little success.\n" +
            "After the ceremony, Tenzin joined Jinora, Asami, Bolin, and Mako on the ferry dock to say goodbye to Korra, who was set to board a ship heading toward the Southern Water Tribe. He urged Korra to not worry about anything other than her recovery, emphasizing that he, his daughter, and the airbenders had everything under control. Months later, he journeyed to the Southern Water Tribe compound, where he was warmly welcomed by Korra, who excitedly dragged him toward the training grounds to show him how much she had improved. When her duel with three firebenders did not turn out well, Tenzin interfered, telling her opponents the sparring match was over. Helping Korra to her feet, he tried to console her by saying that there was no shame in taking the time needed to recover and that her duties as the Avatar could wait. He acknowledged that Korra wanted to help, though emphasized that everything was under control. Before he could tell her she merely needed to be patient, however, she cut him off and threatened to \"water smack\" him in the face if he dared to finish that sentence, prompting him to say that she needed to stop worrying about the future and focus on the progress she had made.[36]\n" +
            "With the Earth Kingdom in need of a leader after Hou-Ting's assassination, Tenzin traveled to Zaofu with President Raiko in order to convince Suyin to take control of the situation. He pointed out that she was the perfect person to take charge as the world leaders trusted her and as a Beifong, she had credibility in the Earth Kingdom. Although they failed to rally Suyin, Tenzin and the other world leaders made Kuvira the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom after she proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se.[37]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "174 AG\n" +
            "Preparing for Wu's coronation\n" +
            "In the three years following the insurrection of the Red Lotus, Tenzin made good on his promise to Korra and sent members of the Air Nation around the Earth Kingdom to help where needed. When he was contacted in 174 AG by the governor of Yi, he sent Kai and Opal out to deal with their situation.\n" +
            "Raiko, Wu, Lin, and Tenzin\n" +
            "Tenzin, Raiko, and Lin tried to reassure Prince Wu that his return to the Earth Kingdom was nearly without danger.\n" +
            "Meanwhile, Tenzin remained in Republic City and attended the opening of the renovated Central City Station with his family, holding Rohan on his shoulders. After the ribbon-cutting, the airbending master informed Prince Wu, the future king of the Earth Kingdom, that the United Forces would escort him to Ba Sing Se after his coronation. When the prince outed his doubts about the safety of his return, Tenzin attempted to assure Wu by stating that the roving bandits were \"mostly\" dispersed, though this failed to assure the prince.\n" +
            "That evening, Tenzin enjoyed dinner back at Air Temple Island together with his family, Asami, Mako, Lin, Wu, and the presidential couple, during which he was unimpressed by his eldest son's proclamation that he had turned into a man and would be unrecognizable to Korra due to that. When an Air Acolyte notified everyone that a Southern Water Tribe ship was pulling up at the dock, Tenzin smiled in anticipation of seeing Korra again. As he made his way out with everyone else, he shook Tonraq's hand, warmly welcoming him back to the city and stating how excited everyone was to see the Avatar again. When the Southern chief confusedly asked if Korra was not already there, Tenzin stated that they were under the impression that she would come back with him. Upon hearing that Korra had left the South six months prior and had written her father letters about being in the city, Tenzin assured Tonraq that they had not seen Korra, leaving everyone to wonder worriedly about the Avatar's whereabouts.[38]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The day before Wu's coronation as the fifty-fourth earth monarch, Tenzin arrived at City Hall, where he found Mako and Raiko eyeing a dancing Wu and dryly remarked that the prince was \"becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership\". Tenzin's attention was drawn away from the prince by Raiko asking him if he had any updates regarding Korra's whereabouts. Having to respond negatively, he assured the president that he had airbenders all over the world on the lookout for her, hoping they would track the Avatar down soon. Tenzin was also concerned about the reports he had heard about Kuvira's growing military and the fact that she was throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps. Although Raiko reassured him that Kuvira was stepping down the following day and that they could then correct any mistakes she might have made, Tenzin was not entirely convinced and stated he would feel better if Korra were there.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Raiko and Tenzin\n" +
            "Concerned about Kuvira's declaration of usurping power in the Earth Kingdom, Tenzin shared a worried glance with Raiko.\n" +
            "The next day, Tenzin sat on the podium with the rest of the world leaders from where he witnessed Wu's coronation as the fifty-fourth earth monarch. When Kuvira speeched after receiving the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, he glanced at Raiko, who was sitting next to him, in concern when the metalbender announced that she had no intention to relinquish the power over the Earth Kingdom to the newly crowned king, denouncing his authority altogether and appointing herself as the leader of the new Earth Empire. Concerned about Kuvira's declarations, Tenzin and the world leaders convened after the coronation and agreed to send Suyin Beifong as their representative to speak with Kuvira and convince her to step down.\n" +
            "Reunion with Korra\n" +
            "When Tenzin returned to Air Temple Island where he gathered his three eldest children in the meditation pavilion and tasked them to bring Korra home as the world would need its Avatar with conflict coming to the Earth Kingdom.[39] As his children prepared to leave on Pepper the next day, Tenzin said to his wife that he could not accompany them as Raiko had asked him to stay behind and help find a diplomatic solution for Kuvira's actions. As Jinora hugged him goodbye, Tenzin inquired if she had been able to get a read on Korra's spiritual energy. Although the answer was negative, he was assured that she would be able to track Korra within a few days. When the three children mounted the flying bison, Tenzin reminded Ikki and Meelo that Jinora was in charge before watching them all take off, hugging Pema in comfort.[40]\n" +
            "Tenzin reuniting with Korra\n" +
            "After her long absence, Tenzin warmly embraced Korra and welcomed her home.\n" +
            "Upon the return of his children a short week later, Tenzin warmly hugged Ikki and praised them all on a job well done. When Meelo asked if he was proud enough of them to bestow him with his mastery tattoos, Tenzin candidly answered negatively, before moving to greet Korra with a hug, welcoming her home. He immediately asked her about the events that occurred in Zaofu, a question for which he was chastised by his brother for ruining the happy reunion. When Korra revealed that she felt like a failure for not being able to stop Kuvira, Tenzin pointed out that no one expected her to face the army commander by herself and that it was all of their responsibility to find a way to deal with Kuvira. He revealed that everyone was just glad to have her back.[41]\n" +
            "Later, Tenzin overheard Korra's conversation with Asami in which she told the engineer that she had failed to change anything in the world as it was more out of balance than ever. Much to the young women's surprise, he agreed with her on the fact that there would always be new conflicts and enemies to face, though he pointing out that the importance of it all was to learn from past enemies and better oneself over time, which was something she had done. He noted that Korra had matured from a hot-headed and slightly selfish person to a thoughtful young woman who placed the needs of others before her own and had become an inspiration to the world.[42]\n" +

            "Hostile spirit vines\n" +
            "World leaders at City Hall\n" +
            "As Raiko proposed a preemptive attack on Kuvira after learning of her super weapon, Tenzin declared that the Air Nation would not help in such an assault.\n" +
            "Weeks after Kuvira annexed Zaofu and effectively reunited the entire Earth Kingdom under the name of her Earth Empire, Tenzin attended a meeting between the world leaders, sans the Water Tribe's representatives, at City Hall to discuss their course of action to stop Kuvira. He raised a skeptical eyebrow at Wu's suggestion to capture Kuvira with the ruse of having won a tropical vacation, silently shooting down the idea. When Raiko suggested to take the fight to her, Tenzin opposed the idea, since the metalbender had yet to undertake any aggressive actions against the United Republic. As Korra later interrupted their meeting and grew offended over the fact that Wu had been invited to take part in the discussion whereas she was left out, he tried to calm her down by pointing out that she should not take it personally and explained that they merely believed they had called her back into action a little too soon. After Varrick and Bolin interrupted the meeting as well and revealed that Kuvira was working on a spirit vine-charged super weapon, a revelation that prompted Raiko to conclude they needed to launch a preemptive strike on the master metalbender, Tenzin sternly told the president that his airbenders would not take part in such an unprovoked attack, a stance in which he was supported by Fire Lord Izumi.\n" +
            "Korra and a worried Tenzin\n" +
            "Worried about Jinora's wellbeing, Tenzin was reluctant to allow Korra to face Zaheer, fearing she would be harmed as well.\n" +
            "After it became apparent that Jinora had been taken captive by hostile spirit vines, Tenzin traveled toward Republic City's Spirit Wilds, where Korra told him she wanted to face Zaheer. Tenzin opposed the request, however, deeming it to be too dangerous. He reasoned that Zaheer could not be trusted, even if he was locked up. He refuted Korra's statement that it was the only way for her to save Jinora, Ryu, and the other tourists, since he planned on calling Tonraq and ask him to lead an expedition into the Spirit World from the Southern portal. When Korra believed his refusal to stem from a loss of faith in her, Tenzin clarified that he was worried about Jinora and could not bear the thought of something happening to Korra as well. Upon her urging that she would be all right, he reluctantly revealed the location of Zaheer's prison and stated he would call Raiko to get her the necessary clearance, for which she hugged him.\n" +
            "Tenzin remained at the entrance of the Spirit Wilds, where he warmly embraced Jinora when she made her way out of the vegetation with the rest of the tourist group. Learning that it had been Korra who had saved them, he smiled fondly at the thought.[43]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Stopping Kuvira\n" +
            "Family hug\n" +
            "Tenzin was thankful for the support he received from his family and embraced them warmly.\n" +
            "When Asami and Varrick had come up with a new weapon to defend the United Republic, Tenzin met up with them, Korra, Mako, and Wu at President Raiko's office.[44] Days later, he attended a new meeting with that group, sans the inventors, to discuss the city's evacuation progress, though it was interrupted by Lin, Suyin, Zhu Li, and Bolin. When the latter informed them that Kuvira's spirit energy cannon was ready and Zhu Li added that Kuvira planned to attack the city two weeks later, Tenzin grew alarmed. With the evacuation now made mandatory, he returned to his family at Air Temple Island and asked them why they had yet to pack their luggage. When Pema informed him that she and his three eldest children wanted to stay and help out, Tenzin embraced them all and thanked them for their support. He suggested that Pema could help out Prince Wu with the evacuation, while Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo could help the other airbenders keep track of the progress of Kuvira's army from above.\n" +
            "Tenzin prepared the attic of the tower on the island to serve as President Raiko's base of operations. When Team Avatar approached him, Lin, and Raiko and announced that they intended to try and take out the spirit energy cannon before it reached the city, Tenzin shot down the idea, reasoning that it was an unnecessary risk, considering the evacuation of the citizens was on schedule and General Iroh was deploying his troops. Despite his reluctance, he let them take a flying bison and leave on their mission. He grew worried, however, when the team already returned the following day and was told that Kuvira's army would arrive in a couple of hours, a week ahead of schedule. Concerned about all the people still in the city, he ordered his wife to immediately find Wu and increase their efforts to evacuate the remaining citizens.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Airbender stealth team\n" +
            "Tenzin was selected by Korra to be part of her airbender stealth team tasked with kidnapping Baatar Jr..\n" +
            "Together with the other airbenders, Tenzin awaited the arrival of Kuvira's army from the top of a roof that gave them a vantage point over the battlefield. Although he had been warned about Kuvira's spirit weapon being attached to an enormous mecha suit, he was still unnerved to see the actual machine. Witnessing the cannon destroying the United Forces' fleet in a matter of seconds, Tenzin and the airbenders retreated to the Future Industries factory where Varrick and Zhu Li were monitoring the manufacturing of the hummingbird mecha suits. When Korra later joined them, alerting them that Raiko had surrendered the city and his army, he agreed with her that kidnapping Baatar Jr. and forcing him to reveal the weaknesses of the mecha suit and the cannon was their best option. He was chosen by her to be part of the stealth airbender team tasked with carrying out that mission. While Jinora and Kai stood guard atop the airship transporting Baatar Jr., he, Bumi, and Korra infiltrated the vessel. They swiftly overpowered the nonbender and after binding and gagging him, Tenzin and Bumi soared off with their wingsuits, carrying the bag with Baatar Jr. between them. Back at the Future Industries factory, he stood by as Korra eventually managed to force Baatar Jr. to contact Kuvira to call off her conquest, though Tenzin had to run for his life moments later when Kuvira traced the radio signal back to their location and blew it up with her spirit energy cannon.[45]\n" +
            "Airbenders attack Kuvira&#039;s mecha suit\n" +
            "Together with nine other airbenders and Korra, Tenzin tried to blow Kuvira's enormous mecha suit off balance.\n" +
            "Tenzin managed to survive the explosion and emerged from the rubble with everyone else when Bolin lifted a large piece of concrete. He quickly assessed Kuvira's progress from atop a rooftop and alerted everyone that she was heading their way with a battalion of mecha suits. While Asami and Varrick attempted to adapt the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits in Asami's office to get them airborne, he and the other benders faced Kuvira and her army in an attempt to stop them or at the very least, slow them down. On Meelo's urging, Tenzin and the other airbenders equipped themselves with balloons filled with paint. Upon reaching the enormous mecha suit, they dropped the balloons on the suit's windows, momentarily obscuring its vision. Tenzin signaled Lin, Wei, and Wing on the ground to try metalbending the joints of the suit, though they soon discovered the joints were made out of platinum and thus impervious to their bending. After Wei and Wing tied the machine's legs together with metal cables and Bolin gave the signal, Tenzin and the other airbenders blasted the suit with air currents in an attempt to knock it off balance. The suit managed to stabilize itself, however, forcing him and the others to flee when Kuvira fired her spirit cannon at them. Sitting dazed on the ground, Jinora checked up on him to see if he was all right, before they all retreated to Asami's office, where a new plan was formed: the benders would relentlessly attack the mecha suit to distract Kuvira and enable the two hummingbird mecha suits to land on the enormous machine and cut a hole in it without being crushed.\n" +
            "Meelo saving Tenzin\n" +
            "Tenzin was saved by Meelo from plummeting to the ground after he was rendered unconscious by narrowly missing a beam from the spirit energy cannon.\n" +
            "As such, when Kuvira aimed her cannon at Korra, Tenzin, his airbending children, Bumi, Kai, Daw, and another female airbender worked together to form a tornado in their wake and swoop down on the weaponized arm of the suit, knocking it off balance and distorting its aim. While he soared away, however, he noticed that Jinora came within range of the cannon herself. At the last second, he swooped down on her, pushing her out of the beam's trajectory, though the proximity of the blast knocked them both unconscious and they plummeted down. Before they could fall on the ground, Jinora was saved by Ikki and Meelo grabbed a hold of Tenzin and positioned himself underneath his father. By airbending at the ground from his feet, Meelo managed to break both their falls and they landed safely, where Tenzin regained consciousness.[11]\n" +
            "Ultimately, their diversion worked and while Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, and Suyin managed to infiltrate the enormous suit, Tenzin was supported by Jinora, while he and his children made their way through the streets of the city. Before they could reach a safe place, however, a wave of energy, caused by the firing of the spirit energy cannon inside Republic City's Spirit Wilds, bore down upon them and they were forced to flee inside the hall of a nearby building, where they all huddled down and Tenzin protected his children against the incoming smoke. As it cleared out, Tenzin was supported by Jinora once again and they made their way to the heart of the Spirit Wilds, where he was surprised to find a new spirit portal. Realizing Korra and Kuvira were nowhere to be found, Tenzin, Team Avatar, and their allies set out to search the area for the Avatar. When Mako reported that there was no sign of her, he quickly ordered them to keep looking, before calling for Korra himself. He was surprised to see all the spirits return a moment later and, when Korra supported Kuvira while emerging from the spirit portal, he was glad to see her again. After Kuvira was handcuffed and escorted away, Tenzin joined his friends and family in the group hug they bestowed on Korra.\n" +

            "Proud Tenzin\n" +
            "Tenzin praised Korra for all that she had already accomplished in her time as the Avatar.\n" +
            "Tenzin later allowed Varrick and Zhu Li to host their wedding on Air Temple Island and attended the wedding ceremony, where he sat between his wife and Lin. During the dinner party, he was seated at the same table as Tonraq and Senna and the presidential couple. When Korra had distanced herself from the party, gazing out to the night skyline of Republic City, he approached her, stating that he had spoken to President Raiko, who planned to announce the following day that they would expand the city rather than rebuild downtown. He complimented her on having transformed the world more in the few years she had been an active Avatar than most of her predecessors did in their lifetimes. Tenzin was pleased to hear Korra say that she felt like she had only begun her journey and that there was more that she desired to learn and do, taking it as a sign of hope. He lovingly placed a hand on her shoulder after she reflected on the purpose of the suffering she had gone through. Their moment was interrupted by Asami, however, who stated that Varrick was looking for him. Learning that the eccentric businessman desired to borrow a wingsuit and jump off the tower, Tenzin immediately ran to find him and prevent that from happening.[46]\n" +

            "Tenzin meditated alongside Korra and his three eldest children.\n" +
            "Tenzin is far more calm and stern in demeanor than his father; however, he does have a sense of humor at times. He also occasionally displays a bit of \"craziness\" himself, though he works hard to suppress this. He always tries to be a calm person, an attempt that is sometimes thwarted by his \"crazy\" children or his siblings. Similarly, his mother described him as having a serious personality since childhood compared to his own siblings. He finds his patience severely tested with the arrival of the impetuous Korra.[5][47] In an attempt to fill his father's footsteps, he works hard to transmit the Air Nomad teachings and culture, while taking his leadership role in Republic City seriously. He does embody the Air Nomad nature of being peaceful and calm, but can sometimes be riled when around his children or toward Korra due to their differing perspectives.[5] Despite his generally calm demeanor, he can become aggressive and prone to do \"whatever it takes\", when his family is threatened or in any danger, exemplified by his willingness to use brute force to break through the Northern defenses surrounding the Southern spirit portal in order to save Jinora.[48] This desperation to protect his family and nation have instilled him with a dangerous inner fury that explodes from him when his loved ones are threatened, much like his father.\n" +
            "Tenzin is a staunch traditionalist, and at times can come across as rather inflexible and stubborn. This also shows in his disdain for pro-bending, which he considers violent, irrelevant, and a perversion to more traditional forms of bending. However, after Korra joined the Fire Ferrets, he brushed up on the rules of the game and seems well versed in the sport and less antagonistic to it than before. He even started cheering during one match. By doing this, he shows that he is willing to show a liking in the interests of those close to him.[10]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Tenzin also appears to be rather prideful and overbearing, as he hid his inability to enter the Spirit World, instead making up excuses that the people around him were preventing him from doing so. When he found out that Jinora was able to see spirits, he grew jealous of her, and kept stubbornly insisting that he should be the one to bring Korra to the Spirit World, stating that Jinora would be unable to face its dangers. Nevertheless, he softened, following his sister's persuasion and daughter's assurance, and expressed how proud he was of Jinora.[24]\n" +

            "As the first airbender among Aang's three children, and the only one during Aang's lifetime, Tenzin has been trained extensively in all of his father's airbending knowledge and prowess. After his father's passing, he became the only airbending master in the world. Ensuring that the teachings and techniques would live on, Tenzin has since been passing on the art to his airbending children, Avatar Korra, and the people who acquired airbending abilities in 171 AG. Though a pacifist at heart, Tenzin has made his combat prowess evident during the first confrontation with the Equalists' mecha tanks, exhibiting air blasts that were powerful enough to knock his opponent backward or even lift them off the ground. Likewise, against another proficient airbender in Zaheer, Tenzin was able to effectively control the battle and gradually wear down his opponent, forcing Zaheer's allies to aid him, to which Tenzin was still able to hold his own for a short period.[33]\n" +

            "Tenzin is well-versed in all airbending techniques, including one of his own invention, a variant of Aang's air scooter technique.[49] Tenzin conjured a \"wheel\" of air which not only allowed him to evade attacks, but was powerful enough to deflect the claws of the mecha tanks. He is also able to use a glider by bending the air around it. Tenzin is skilled in creating extremely powerful tornadoes that are strong enough to throw the mecha tanks in the air. He was also capable of creating an air dome of sorts to protect himself and others from any harmful gases. Tenzin was the first known individual to land a solid strike on Amon, sending him and some of his men flying away with an airbending kick, though he did have some assistance from Mako at the time. Tenzin has also displayed the ability to use airbending in order to conduct a spiritual cleansing of an area, which can restore a place's connection with the Spirit World.\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Despite being middle-aged, Tenzin is in excellent physical shape and has proven himself a highly nimble and evasive fighter.[29] When the Equalists launched a sneak attack to capture him, he effortlessly dodged their initial assault with no wasted movement. Even when his hands were bound, he was able to calmly dodge all of a chi blocker's close-range attacks. He also has excellent stamina for his age as he can go for a ten-mile hike without tiring. While defending the Northern Air Temple from the Red Lotus' elemental masters, Tenzin displayed incredible physical resilience when being beaten by all four, sustaining severe injuries without losing consciousness.\n" +

Although her mother taught Avatar Korra's previous incarnation how to earthbend, Lin displayed no affection toward her when they first met. However, Lin's feelings toward the young Avatar changed when Amon and his Equalists made their public appearance and openly challenged the benders of the world.[4] Lin is brave, loyal, and willing to sacrifice herself in order to do what she believes is right.\n" +

            "Early life\n" +
            "Born to Toph Beifong and Kanto two decades after the Hundred Year War, Lin inherited the earthbending prowess of her mother and eventually mastered the art and two of its sub-skills, metalbending and seismic sense. Due to Toph's childhood being one of constant restriction, she gave Lin and her half-sister, Suyin, much more freedom, though she did not divulge to them their respective fathers' identities, which was something that would plague Lin while growing up.[5] Toph's carefree parenting eventually led Lin and Suyin to competing for her attention. Lin later followed in her mother's footsteps and joined the Metalbending Police Force.[6]\n" +
            "After joining the Republic City Police Force, Lin came home one day in 138 AG,[7] to notice Suyin skipping school and hanging out with her suspicious friends. Upon confronting her about it, she was harshly told by Suyin that it was none of her business. Lin stopped her from leaving and told her she was ruining her life, prompting her half-sister to retort by saying that she at least had a life before leaving behind a fuming Lin.\n" +

            "Having very different personalities, a young Lin and Suyin ultimately came to blows with each other.\n" +
            "Sometime in 142 AG, Lin intercepted a getaway car from a robbery. The suspects proved to be Suyin's friends, who were members of the Terra Triad. She was surprised to learn that Suyin was the getaway driver. Lin expressed her anger over her sister's involvement with the Terra Triad. Although Suyin insisted that she only drove the getaway car as a favor, Lin remained unconvinced and threatened her as she began to walk away from the scene. After Suyin dismissed her, Lin tried to apprehend her by snagging her wrist with a cable. While trying to stop Suyin running away, her line was cut by her exasperated sibling, resulting in it snapping back and scarring Lin's face. The two sisters were later brought in front of their mother at her police office, where both were reprimanded. Lin refused to accept the blame because Suyin was running around with criminals. At her mother's request, Lin turned over the arrest report, but watched in shock as Toph tore it, believing the incident could not be covered up. The young officer was angered, especially at the reasoning that Toph, being chief, could not have a daughter in jail, taking it as a sign that her sister could do what she wanted. Lin saw this event as the reason why Toph retired from the police force a year later; Toph supposedly being guilt-ridden of her actions and thus refusing to forgive her half-sister for not taking responsibility. This belief influenced Lin to refuse talking to Suyin, even after Suyin and Toph reconciled with each other many years later.[1] In 154 AG, Lin and Toph ceased communicating with each other and never spoke again until twenty years later.[5] While Suyin later founded the Metal Clan, Lin rose through the ranks of the police force to eventually become Republic City's Chief of Police.\n" +
            "As her mother was friends with Avatar Aang, Lin and Tenzin had known each other since childhood and according to Tenzin, she got along \"famously\" with his father. Earlier in her life, she dated Tenzin, but the two eventually drifted apart, as they had different goals in life, and the relationship ended after Pema confessed her love for the airbender.

The two had a conversation in which Lin explained that she held no favoritism toward the young Avatar despite the fact that her mother and Aang were friends. When Tenzin arrived, Lin begrudgingly agreed to drop the charges against Korra, though made it clear that she wanted the Avatar \"out of [her] city\". The next day, the Chief attended a press conference during which Korra made her first public appearance as the Avatar in Republic City. At that time, the new Avatar was also asked if she would be working with Chief Beifong, a question to which she did not reply.[10]\n" +

Lin, however, entered City Hall and, albeit reluctantly, agreed with Korra and demanded that the Council show some backbone. In exchange for keeping the arena open, the Chief agreed to provide heavy security for the event. This agreement convinced Tarrlok and the rest of the Council to leave the arena open. Tenzin encountered Lin later and offered to provide her protection during the event, but she demanded that she not be babysat, insisting she could take care of herself. Korra approached Lin and expressed her gratitude to Lin for agreeing with her in the Council meeting, however, she ignored the Avatar's thanks.\n" +

As Tenzin became enraged about the Wolfbats' blatant disregard of the rules, Lin became amused, claiming that she did not think he would know the rules of pro-bending. The two exchanged some conversation during the match as the Wolfbats won a controversial victory, mostly after Korra won her tie-breaker match with Tahno. Lin became somewhat impressed, remarking that she could not believe that the sweet-tempered Aang was reincarnated into Korra, whom she described to be \"tough as nails\". Tenzin commented that Korra reminded him of Lin at that age and that he believed they would get along if she would give her a chance.\n" +
            "Despite Lin's maximum security, the Equalists formulated a plan and her preparations were rendered useless.

The chief was left making the hard decision between possibly capturing Amon, or saving Korra's life, and in a selfless act Lin chose the latter. Korra thanked the metalbender for saving her life.

Councilman Tarrlok even proposed in a press conference that she be replaced as the Chief of Police. Lin began conducting numerous investigations with Tenzin, interrogating the witnesses of the incident in the arena. She later received intelligence that Cabbage Corp had manufactured the Equalist weaponry, so the Metalbending Police Force proceeded to shut down the company and arrest the owner.\n" +
            "When Lin and Tenzin were alerted by Korra of a possible connection between Hiroshi Sato and the Equalists, the metalbender at first doubted about its veracity, but agreed with Tenzin that he would have both the means and the motive. The Chief and the airbender went to the Sato estate to question him further. The businessman excused his guilt, claiming it was all a simple misunderstanding; he also welcomed Lin's officers to search his factories. However, Lin and her men were not able to find any substantial evidence to incriminate Sato.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As the investigation came to an end, a worker in the factory slipped Korra a note telling her to meet him underneath the Silk Road Bridge. Korra, Lin, and Tenzin met the worker, who explained that Sato was an Equalist and that he had indeed manufactured the weapons used during the arena attack. The worker also revealed that Sato was preparing to launch a new, more powerful weapon, which he was making in a secret factory underneath his mansion.\n" +

            "Lin, Korra, Tenzin, and the metalbenders faced Hiroshi's mecha tank.\n" +
            "Lin, Korra, and Tenzin, escorted by some metalbending officers, conducted a second search of the Sato estate, and discovered a massive factory with Equalist propaganda and several weapons, including new, massive robot-like machines, mecha tanks. However, they soon realized they had been lured into a trap as Hiroshi Sato sealed the factory off, and began to fight Lin, Korra, Tenzin, and the officers with the new machines. While the group was able to fend off Sato, he and the Equalists eventually overpowered the benders and rendered them unconscious. Hiroshi ordered his men to bind everyone and bring them to Amon.\n" +
            "Meanwhile, Mako and Bolin entered the factory and attempted to carry Korra, Tenzin, and Lin to the surface; however, Hiroshi soon discovered them and prepared to attack the brothers. They were saved by the appearance of Asami, who had also made her way to the factory. After a brief conversation with her father, Asami used an electrified glove to knock out Hiroshi and the Lieutenant, giving time for everyone, herself included, to escape via airship. However, they were forced to leave Lin's officers behind as they could not carry them, and the Equalists had already begun to load them into the trucks.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "While on the airship heading back to the city, Lin, still in pain from the attack, told Tenzin that she feared for the fate of her men and, since she had failed twice as police chief, was planning to turn in her resignation in the morning. Tenzin told her to not give up the fight, but the metalbender stated she was resigning so that she could find her men and take down Amon her way: outside of the law.[12]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Lin officially presented her resignation as chief the next morning and turned her position over to Saikhan.[13]\n" +

            "Searching for Avatar Korra\n" +
            "While Lin was in the hospital recovering from her injuries, Saikhan had taken over as the Chief of Police, with Tarrlok developing an increased influence over the new chief. In this time, Tarrlok unjustly arrested a crowd of nonbenders, as well as Mako, Bolin, and Asami.\n" +
            "Lin rescuing her officers\n" +
            "Lin rescued the officers captured during the battle at the Equalist factory.\n" +
            "Some days later, Lin awoke to a radio broadcast announcing that Korra had been kidnapped by the Equalists. She went to the prison and quickly freed Asami, Mako, and Bolin. Tenzin soon joined the group, and they went to search for Korra and Lin's captured men. Uncovering a network of tunnels under the city, the four, including Tenzin, discovered and infiltrated the Equalist hideout. Lin also found the officers who she was forced to abandon underneath Hiroshi Sato's mansion; however, once she discovered that Amon had already taken their bending away, she expressed regret and apologized for arriving too late. Several minutes later, a chi blocker they had captured told them under duress that the Equalists had never kidnapped Korra and that Tarrlok had been lying. With the help of Lin's earthbending and metalbending, they escaped from their pursuers via tram, the group making its way out of the underground tunnels to the surface. From there, they traveled toward City Hall to confront Tarrlok.\n" +
            "Once they arrived, the group challenged Tarrlok's story of what had happened the previous night, telling him they knew he was lying and had Korra. His assistant revealed that he was a bloodbender, and he had, in fact, kidnapped the Avatar. Lin and Tenzin readied themselves for combat, but Tarrlok knocked the entire group unconscious by bloodbending them. After they woke up, they resumed their search for Korra.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Later, when Lin and the others heard Naga howl, they traveled to the source of the sound and found the polar bear dog with Korra on her back. Lin attempted to find out from Korra where Tarrlok was, but Mako pushed her aside, demanding that they all gave Korra some space.[14]\n" +

            "After Tenzin arrived, Lin stayed with his family and before the airbender had to leave for an important Council meeting, he asked Lin to look after his wife and children, to which she agreed. Pema arrived shortly afterward and handed her Meelo, stating that he needed a wash, much to Lin's displeasure. After Tenzin left to meet with the other council members, sounds of explosions made it clear that Republic City was under attack, prompting Lin to order the family to go inside. When the Equalists arrived on the island, she tried to defend herself, but was electrified. Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo came to her rescue and defeated the group of attackers in a small battle with surprising ease. As more airships were heading toward the island, Tenzin decided to take his family to a safer location away from Republic City.\n" +
            "Lin knew the family would need protection and accompanied them, taking it upon herself to protect the last airbenders in existence. As she and Tenzin's family fled, two Equalist airships pursued them. After tearing up the net launched by one of the airships, Lin made the difficult decision to attack the aircraft, telling Tenzin not to turn back, no matter what happened to her. Using the broken net's cable, she jumped off of Oogi and climbed atop the airship using her metal wires. Once on top, she ripped a hole in the metal and tore the top of the airship in two. She jumped to the second one to do the same, but was ambushed by Equalists and knocked out with electrified bolas.\n" +

            "Following the capture of the metalbender, the lone Equalist airship turned back and stopped pursuing Tenzin and his family. Lin's sacrifice prompted Meelo to declare her his hero, a statement with which Tenzin solemnly agreed.\n" +
            "Lin was brought back to Air Temple Island to face Amon. He inquired about Korra's whereabouts, telling her that if she complied, he would not remove her bending. Lin, tied up and defenseless, chose to remain silent and willingly sacrificed her bending in order to protect the Avatar. Amon removed her bending and she collapsed to the ground.\n" +

After Amon was outed as a bender, Lin traveled with Team Avatar and Tenzin's family to the Southern Water Tribe compound, where Korra hoped Katara would be able to restore her bending. When Katara said she was unable to restore Korra's bending, Lin grievingly remarked that Katara, the best healer in the world, must be able to do something, as otherwise Amon's damage could never be undone. However, when Korra ran away on Naga, she was visited by Aang's spirit, who restored her bending through energybending. Later, Korra used energybending to restore Lin's earthbending, substantiated when Lin raised a number of boulders surrounding their location. Afterward, she thanked Korra for restoring her bending. Some time after she returned to Republic City, she was reinstated as Chief of Police. Due to Mako's good work in busting triads, Lin believed he could make it to detective.[15]\n" +

She ordered Mako to resume his position as an officer, as there would be a peace march orchestrated by the Southerners later in the evening and he was needed to safeguard the order. However, despite the significant police force Lin had deployed, the peace march was disturbed by the bombing of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center.\n" +

When Mako interrupted said meeting, bringing news about the bombing, she snapped at him, ordering him to give the evidence he found to Lu and Gang, the officers in charge of the bombing case.\n" +
            "Later that day, Lin exited her office, finding the police station to be a mess. When she demanded to know what had happened, Mako stated that he had broken up with the Avatar. Amused, she commented that he got off easy compared to her break up with Tenzin.[8]\n" +

            "When the news about the fifth robbery of one of Varrick Global Industries' ships reached Republic City, Lin questioned the captain of the ship in hopes of finding a lead to the culprits. Much to her dismay, her interview was interrupted by Mako, who was convinced that there was a link between the robbery and the bombing of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. Angered, she shot down Mako's ideas, not taking the time to listen to them, and ordered him to drop his investigation and go out on the streets to do his job, as he was not a detective, but a beat cop.[16]\n" +

            "A few days later, Lin traveled to Mako's apartment with Lu and Gang to investigate an incriminating lead she had been given by members of the Triple Threat Triad they had arrested. Mako admitted he had hired the Triple Threats for a sting operation, but Lin informed the young firebender that the information she had been given by the gangsters suggested he had assisted them in stealing from the Future Industries warehouse. Although Mako denied the allegations, Lin stated she was obligated to follow up on the lead. When Lu showed Lin the money and explosives he had found during his search of the apartment, she asked Mako why he possessed explosives, and despite both his and Asami's protestations that there had been a mistake, she left the apartment with Mako in handcuffs.[17]\n" +
            "Lin and her fellow officers later provided security at the Pro-bending Arena during the showing of the final installment of The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South. Lin was alarmed when a waterbender was knocked onto the water and Bolin subsequently started battling three others on the center stage of the arena. She ordered her men to secure President Raiko and call for backup immediately. When Varrick was outed to be the mastermind behind the attempted kidnapping of President Raiko, Lin arrested him and by proxy, his assistant, Zhu Li, as she refused to leave her employer's side. With Mako's allegations proven right, Lin cleared him of all charges, and noted that he would \"make a fine detective\", while demoting Lu and Gang for their incompetence. She accompanied Team Avatar to Varrick's cell, where they learned of his battleship, the Zhu Li, which he provided for them to use in traveling to the South.[18]\n" +

When their airship was shot down by the Dark Avatar, she urged her officers to leave the ship and took hold of the President, leading him to safety on a nearby rooftop, from where she oversaw the destruction caused by the Dark Avatar.[20]\n" +

            "Two weeks after Harmonic Convergence, Lin was present at a press conference outside City Hall to address the disastrous overgrowth of spirit vines that had resulted from the integration of spirits and humans. She cut short an argument between Raiko and Korra over the blame each shouldered for the situation and promptly declared an end to the conference.\n" +
            "The next day, Lin and Mako made their way to Air Temple Island. When Lin saw Bumi punching at air, she asked the spectators if he was fighting an invisible spirit monster. Tenzin informed her that his brother had developed airbending abilities, only for the police chief to tell him that Bumi was not alone.\n" +

After Tenzin explained to Korra who the criminals were and that they had threatened to kidnap the Avatar, Lin added that they never got any answers as to their motive before insisting that Korra return with her to Republic City. When Korra declared that she was not leaving without freeing Ba Sing Se's airbenders, however, Lin decided to join the mission.\n" +
            "During the night, Lin and Asami took their airships to help extract the airbenders from the Earth Queen's temple before departing the city. After being radioed by Bumi that the group had freed them, Lin directed her airship over the Earth Queen's Temple, and the escapees and Bumi ascended the temple's scaffolding to reach the ship, with Bumi altering Lin to move once they were all aboard. Once they were far away from Ba Sing Se, Lin joined Team Avatar in searching for more airbenders while Tenzin, Jinora, and Bumi took the airbenders to the Northern Air Temple.[9]\n" +

Naga presented the police chief with the ball being used for fetch, but upon seeing it covered in saliva, Lin passed on throwing it. Mako and Asami soon came out of the airship and alerted the rest of the team about a new airbender in Zaofu, home to the metal clan. Korra asked Lin if she knew the place, but the metalbender claimed she had never heard of it and said she would prefer her back safely in Republic City. Korra and the rest of the group, however, insisted on investigating the report of the airbender, and thus they ventured to the city. Before leaving, Naga again gestured for Lin to play, but she smashed the polar bear dog's ball with her metal cable out of frustration.\n" +
            "When Bolin saw the city was made of metal, he told Lin she should feel right at home, but she continued to sit and gave a noncommittal mumble in response. Upon landing in Zaofu, Lin remained aboard the airship, telling Team Avatar just to get the airbender and not to reveal her presence to the city's inhabitants; she refused to explain her reasoning for not coming along. Lin's presence, however, was soon found out by Suyin, and she went with the team to the airship to reunite with her half-sister, but Lin declared she had nothing to say to her. The half-siblings argued, Lin believing that Suyin tore the family apart; Suyin fired back by saying Lin had kept it that way. Upon being told that her niece, Opal, was the airbender, Lin showed no excitement.\n" +

            "Lin meets Opal\n" +
            "Lin was indifferent upon meeting her niece Opal for the first time.\n" +
            "The group went with Suyin to her home, where they were first introduced to three of Lin's nephews before finally met Opal; along the way, Lin showed no interest in talking them. Once they met Opal, Lin's first response was that they take her and leave right there. After Suyin calmly introduced her daughter to her aunt, Opal was excited, saying she had heard many stories about Lin, but the metalbender simply looked away, mildly stating that she was sure of that. When Suyin informed the group of their accommodations and desire for Korra to train Opal, Lin still insisted that they leave as Korra explained to Suyin about the four criminals hunting her. Upon the matriarch assuring the group that Zaofu was the safest city in the world, Lin rolled her eyes.\n" +
            "At dinner, Lin made flippant responses to Suyin's delight at having five children, believing it to be a nightmare, and countered her half-sister's remark of it being a blessing by saying that their mother said as such, but never really meant it. She also responded to Suyin's belief that the Earth Queen could do what she wanted by saying that it sounded familiar, though promptly dismissed her when asked what she said. After her half-sibling expressed further views on the monarchy, Lin sarcastically called her an expert of world affairs, and refused to tell an angered Suyin what was bothering her. Before the sisters could get to verbal blows, they were interrupted by Varrick, who had taken refuge in Zaofu. This only made Lin lash out at her half-sister, telling her that while she was trying to keep the Avatar safe, Suyin was harboring a criminal. Suyin tried to explain that she believed people to be capable of change, but Lin stood up and told her that she had not before throwing her chair and storming out of the dining room.\n" +

            "Later that night, Lin was visited in her room by Opal and Korra; Lin angrily insisted that they talk. She was approached by her niece, who apologized for the difficult stay and expressed that, after getting excited from stories about Lin told by Suyin and Toph, she was sad that her aunt did not want to get to know her. After Opal expressed her desire for Lin to be a part of the family, the police chief only responded with a cold \"get out\". When Opal tried to apologize, Lin expressed the same sentiment more definitively, causing Opal to run out in tears. Korra scolded Lin for her behavior, insisting she only wanted to do something nice, but Lin lashed out the Avatar, saying that she should be focused on saving the world, not trying to fix her family. The Avatar left, but not before proclaiming that the metalbender would never change and would always be a lonely and bitter woman, making Lin bury her face in her hands and cry while alone.[6]\n" +
            "The next morning, Lin did not join the team for breakfast, instead walking out to find two guards idly having a conversation, causing her to demand they get back to work. Aiwei approached, asking if everything was all right, to which she answered that the Avatar was in danger. She refused to accept his claim about Zaofu being the safest place in the world, vowing to search everywhere for any sign of a problem. She also tried to claim she was fine despite her apparent stress. Noticing this, Aiwei warned her that her health and job could be at risk.

After being assured she had nothing to be scared of, she bluntly stated she was not scared before being advised to close her eyes and take a deep breath. As the needles were stuck into her, Lin did not feel anything, causing Guo to conclude her chi was deeply blocked and they needed more needles. She laughed off the concept of the treatment being able to reach into one's buried memories, but when the last needle was placed, she saw herself reliving her past confrontation with Suyin regarding the decisions she was making and began to sweat significantly. She subsequently flashed back to her chase of the Terra Triad and discovery that Suyin was helping them escape charges of theft. At that moment, Lin awoke and shot the needles out of her body, preparing to leave against Guo's advice, not caring if abandoning the session made her sick.\n" +
            "After returning to her room at Suyin's estate, she found herself approached by what she took as a young Suyin, though soon realized it was actually Korra, who wondered if she was going to sulk around all day and told her she needed to apologize to Opal, but when the Avatar noticed Lin appeared to be in bad shape, the metalbender said she was fine and began to walk away, although wobbling and out of breath.\n" +

She subsequently told Suyin she could have taken responsibility for her actions when they were in Toph's office, but instead just stood by and let their mother throw her career away, rejecting Suyin's counter-claim that Toph simply retired, saying it was only because she felt ashamed to continue her police work. She also laughed off Suyin saying she made some mistakes in childhood and refused to believe she changed just because her sister had \"a big, fancy house and a chef who cooked [her] fancy food\", saying she could see right through her. After being told by her sibling that she was a bitter, selfish woman and it was why Tenzin left her, Lin attacked with a rock, sparking a duel. She was quickly knocked down by a fragment of meteorite, but quickly recovered. She attempted to use both earth and metal to take down Suyin, even going so far as to use one of Huan's metal sculptures, but all her attacks were dodged. Lin soon found herself knocked into stairs that led to a gazebo by Suyin's bending of the metal wall at her. Claiming she had not vented completely, Lin bent the stairs and prepared to attack again, but both siblings found their weapons blown away by an angry Opal, who demanded to know why they wanted to hurt each other. Lin subsequently passed out from exhaustion and fell into a sixteen-hour slumber.\n" +
            "Upon waking up, Lin felt well-rested and was in a substantially more positive mood, warmly greeting Korra, Bolin, and Mako before walking to the dining hall. She enjoyed a specially-prepared drink from the chef before sighting Opal outside the hall, prompting her to call her in for a talk. Lin apologized for her behavior, explaining she was not comfortable talking about such personal matters and that she and Suyin had a complicated relationship. She complemented Opal for being smart and an excellent airbender, believing it would be a wonderful opportunity for her to train at the Northern Air Temple. Hearing that Opal did not want to upset her mom, Lin sympathized, explaining that her joining with the Metalbending Police Force and becoming chief were to please Toph, but it did not.

            "Later, while looking at a statue of Toph, Lin was approached by Suyin, who informed her of Opal's decision to leave for airbending training, knowing that Lin had something to do with it. Her attempt to explain was cut off by her reassuring half-sister, who lamented that while they had too much freedom from their mother, she did not give Opal enough. After Suyin wondered where she would be without having been sent away from the city, Lin joked her sister would be in prison. She was complemented by Suyin for her work as police chief and, upon being told Toph would be proud, she idly turned to look at the statue of their mother again. Lin was asked if they could move on, perhaps even living with her family and joining her dance troupe as co-director, she slowed her sister down, simply proposing she just did not show up at her house and attack again. Upon Suyin's agreement, the siblings shook hands and Lin smiled at her.[1]\n" +

Lin helped Suyin, Wei, Wing, and the guards surround the criminals in metal panels, but the groups were separated when Ghazan turned the ground into a pool of lava, prompting her to catapult backward on a rock. She and the other members of Team Avatar hid behind a metal panel, occasionally rising to attempt attacks. They were saved from P'Li's combustion attack when Suyin, Wei, and Wing bent another panel toward them for shielding. Lin wanted to know how they got in, but her half-sibling had no idea. Upon Suyin's proposal to drop from the roof on cables to rescue Korra, Lin expressed skepticism as P'Li could attack them on sight. With a plan in place for Bolin to disable P'Li's abilities, Lin, Suyin, and the twins made their way to the dome's roof. At Wing's signal, the half-sisters descended, with Bolin able to disable P'Li at the last second. Lin retrieved Korra and the two began to ascend, but she found herself briefly caught by one of Ming-Hua's water tendrils. Mako was able to break the grip, allowing the escape to continue, but they were pursued by Zaheer on his glider. Suyin defeated him by shooting four arrows into the glider, which Lin thanked her for. However, upon regathering in her half-sister's office for Korra's recovery, the police chief demanded to know how the incident happened. She also told one of the guards, Kuvira, to keep searching for the criminals even though she found no sign of them.\n" +
            "With the group having concluded that the only way the Red Lotus could have gotten to the estate by working with one of the guards, Lin watched the next morning as Aiwei questioned them and Varrick, but when the initial round came up empty, she suggested Suyin as a possible culprit, but her half-sister's innocence was determined to be true. Lin soon looked on as it was discovered that a guard, Hong Li, appeared to be the one who assisted their foes.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Lin scanning the tunnel\n" +
            "Lin used her seismic sense to scan for Aiwei's presence, but was ultimately unable to find him.\n" +
            "Later that day, Lin and Suyin rushed to Aiwei's house after hearing an explosion. Korra explained to them that he was the real traitor and had lied about the guard, escaping upon confrontation. Using seismic sense, the chief concluded he must have collapsed his escape tunnel. Upon Kuvira's approach, Lin told her and any available guards to search the mountainside and find the tunnel's exit. She also comforted a distressed Suyin over Aiwei's betrayal.\n" +
            "Back in Suyin's office, Lin and the group were informed that while the guards found the tunnel's exit, they concluded he had already escaped, finding just tire marks. She did not want Team Avatar to go chasing the group, believing there could be secret agents hunting Korra, and wanted her to return to Republic City. Korra protested, saying the mission to find the Red Lotus was her job; Lin demanded she not lecture her about jobs. Suyin promptly intervened, voicing apparent agreement with Lin, which the chief thanked her half-sister for.[22]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Tracking Korra\n" +
            "The next morning, after a half-hour's wait, Lin approached Suyin, wondering where Team Avatar was. Learning they had left in pursuit of Aiwei, she felt betrayed by her half-sister for letting Korra go after previously supporting Lin. Upon being told she could not control Korra's every move, the police chief decided she would try anyway and left the city.[23]\n" +
            "Lin, Naga, and Pabu\n" +
            "Lin distracted Naga and Pabu with some meat snacks, enabling herself to radio Tonraq about Korra's last known location, the Misty Palms Oasis.\n" +
            "Lin tracked down the team's jeep toward the Misty Palms Oasis, though when she investigated the now abandoned vehicle, she was scared by a roaring Naga. As the polar bear dog recognized her, Lin was promptly licked enthusiastically. After giving Pabu and Naga some meat to chew on, she radioed Tonraq, imploring him meet her at the oasis. After the Southern chief had arrived with Zuko, the trio awaited Korra's return at the local cantina. When the Avatar and Asami finally arrived, Lin somewhat bitterly thanked her for being ditched at Zaofu, before alerting the girls that Mako and Bolin had been captured by Zaheer and his crew.[24]\n" +
            "Upon Mako and Bolin's return to the Misty Palms Oasis, Lin came out of the cantina to greet the brothers, stating she was glad they were not dead. When she learned the Red Lotus' plan to destroy the Air Nation at the Northern Air Temple, she told them the Metal Clan would have a strong radio transmitter with which they could warn Tenzin and the airbenders to evacuate to safety.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Lin comforting Suyin\n" +
            "Lin tried to comfort her sister, who was worried about Opal's safety at the Northern Air Temple.\n" +
            "As they reached Zaofu, they were greeted by Suyin, who reported that even though they had a strong signal that reached the temple, no one was answering. Upon hearing her half-sister voice her concern over Opal, Lin placed a comforting arm around her, stating everything would be okay. While Suyin prepared her airship for takeoff toward the temple, Lin opposed Korra's plan to meditate into the Spirit World to try and trap Zaheer's soul in the off chance he would be there as they would not be able to protect her there. However, realizing they had to try something, she relented and went to help her sister made the necessary preparations for their journey.[25]\n" +
            "Attempt to rescue Korra\n" +
            "On board the Zaofu airship bound for the Northern Air Temple, Lin was discussing a plan of attack with her allies. She dismissed Suyin's suggestion of an ambush attack from the air because P'Li would pick them off one by one. When asked if she had a better plan, Lin suggested dropping the valley and catching them off-guard by climbing up the mountain. Suyin was skeptical as it would give the Red Lotus the high ground and Ghazan the opportunity to melt them off the mountainside. Korra stated any effort would be in vain because Zaheer would wipe out the airbenders upon sighting the team, instead simply suggesting to the group she turn herself over to save the Air Nation. After they learned of Zaheer's desire to meet Korra alone at Laghima's Peak, Suyin came up with a plan to utilize their numbers advantage, having Lin, Tonraq, and the other metalbenders wait at the base of the peak. Before separating, Lin gave Mako a radio, telling him to alert her upon sight of the airbenders.\n" +
            "Suyin and Lin\n" +
            "Lin told Suyin that she loved her before going out to distract P'Li.\n" +
            "While the metalbenders were slowly climbing the mountain, Mako radioed Lin to inform them of the Red Lotus' double-cross and told her to get Korra out. At her command, the metalbenders rapidly ascended and confronted Zaheer and P'Li, the latter of whom moved to hold them off. Suyin and Lin fired large slabs of rock at the combustionbender while dodging her dangerous attacks. However, the half-siblings were forced to take cover behind a large rock due to P'Li's continuous strikes. Lin decided to draw P'Li's fire, telling Suyin to take her out, telling her dismayed sibling she loved her before initiating the plan. She went out, taunting P'Li by calling her a Third-Eye Freak and worked to dodge her attacks while firing slabs of earth at her. However, the police chief was soon hit by a blast, throwing her to the edge of the cliff. Just as Lin was about be finished off, Suyin bent her plate of armor at the combustionbender, causing P'Li's blast to blow up in her face, killing her. The metalbenders promptly swarmed in and surrounded Zaheer; Lin telling him to release Korra. When Zaheer intentionally slipped off the edge, the siblings ran toward it, only to see the airbender floating in mid-air. Suyin and Lin tried to capture him with metal cables, but the criminal flew away, much to their shock, the latter wondering out loud if he just flew.\n" +
            "Kai and Team Avatar\n" +
            "While the wounded were tended to, Lin learned of the airbenders and Korra's location.\n" +
            "The group reunited in a forest away from the temple with Kai having helped saved Mako, Bolin, Asami, and Tenzin; Lin asked how they made it out alive, to which Mako told them about Bolin's newfound lavabending abilities and Kai's rescue. The police chief, however, sadly told Tenzin that Zaheer had escaped with Korra. After Suyin told the rest of their allies about Zaheer's ability to fly, Lin told a skeptical Bolin that she would not believe it if she had not seen it herself. When Kai tried to make a suggestion, Lin initially brushed him off, but the young airbender subsequently told them about the location of the captive airbenders and probable location of Korra: a secret cave. She asked him if Ghazan and Ming-Hua were present for rounding up the airbenders from P'Li, to which she was told it was actually four other individuals. She told the group they needed to get to the caves; at that point, Oogi arrived, giving the group a means of transportation to reach the location in question.[26]\n" +
            "Rescuing the airbenders\n" +
            "Lin and Bumi\n" +
            "Lin helped a heavily wounded Bumi outside of the cave-complex.\n" +
            "Kai led the group to the cave. The group, sans Tenzin, burst into the cave. Lin used her earthbending to blast a whole into the room where the airbenders and others were being held. After the captives were released from their bonds, Lin helped them get out of the cave, focusing especially on a substantially weakened Bumi and Kya, as Bolin, Mako, and Tonraq went to rescue Korra.\n" +
            "After everyone had emerged from the cave, they watched Korra and Zaheer duel. When Kai suggested he try and go after Zaheer, Lin told him he would have no chance because he was too powerful. The airbenders, however, combined their efforts, saving Korra and throwing Zaheer to the ground. Lin and Suyin promptly trapped Zaheer in an earth shell. The Avatar, however, had been poisoned, severely weakening her and leaving her on the verge of death. When Zaheer began laughing, Lin asked what was funny; she was told the Red Lotus had been successful. Because of the poison's metallic structure, however, they had a chance to save her. The police chief watched with worry as her sibling attempted to bend the poison out, though ultimately, she succeeded. She also gave Bolin a weird look after stuffing his sock in a ranting Zaheer's mouth.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Lin comforting Korra\n" +
            "Lin placed a comforting hand on Korra's shoulder, telling her to hang on as things would get better.\n" +
            "Two weeks later on Air Temple Island, Lin joined her half-sister, Tenzin and his family, Korra's family, Lord Zuko, and President Raiko, watching as Asami brought out a debilitated Korra in a wheelchair. She helped the girls, Ikki, and Meelo reach the ceremonial temple by kicking up a slab of rock and raising it to the top of the stairs. The police chief later attended Jinora's airbending mastery ceremony, smiling as Tenzin praised both the airbender and the Avatar for their efforts in saving the Air Nation and watching as Jinora's tattoos were revealed.[27]\n" +
            "174 AG\n" +
            "Preparing for Wu's coronation\n" +
            "Lin and Mako\n" +
            "Lin felt bad to tell Mako that he was to be the permanent bodyguard for Prince Wu, knowing it would displease him.\n" +
            "When President Raiko held a public ceremony to reopen Central City Station in 174 AG, Lin was present and guarded Prince Wu. After the ceremony ended, she tried to calm the prince's nerves about returning to the Earth Kingdom by stating that the chances he would be assassinated were almost zero. When she learned that Prince Wu had reached an agreement with President Raiko about Mako's permanent relocation to Ba Sing Se as the prince's personal bodyguard, Lin tried to protect her detective and keep him in the city, though the decision was made above her head, leaving her powerless to stop it. Later that night, she attended dinner at Air Temple Island, where she felt awkward to break the news to Mako. As an Air Acolyte alerted everyone about the arrival of a ship from the South, Lin and the others gathered at the dock to greet its passengers. However, upon learning that Korra was not among them and supposedly had left for the city six months prior though had failed to check in with any of them, everyone grew worried about the Avatar's whereabouts.[28]\n" +
            "Later, Lin provided security with the rest of her police force during Wu's coronation ceremony as Earth King, where she also bore witness to Kuvira's declaration of usurping power in the Earth Kingdom, which she renamed \"Earth Empire\".[29]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Saving her family\n" +
            "Lin and Opal\n" +
            "Lin told Opal that the world leaders were not going to attack Kuvira, so they would have to free their family themselves.\n" +
            "Weeks later, Lin was present at the meeting between the world leaders to decide on their course of action against Kuvira. Eager to free her family, she reiterated that Kuvira could not be trusted, since she had already broken her word before by not relinquishing power as she had said she would. She sided with President Raiko, supporting the idea to go on the offensive, and proposed to start their campaign by liberating Zaofu. After Tenzin and Fire Lord Izumi's opposition to a preemptive strike, the meeting was concluded with the decision that the United Republic would restrict itself to taking defensive measures and Lin left City Hall to find Opal. She interrupted her and Bolin's conversation, desiring to speak with her niece privately. Revealing that Raiko had failed to convince the other world leaders to attack Kuvira, Lin declared that they would have to save their family themselves, denouncing the help of anyone else, since it was an unsanctioned and dangerous mission into enemy territory and she was unwilling to let anyone else risk their lives for their family.\n" +
            "Lin, Mako, and Korra\n" +
            "Torn between protecting the Avatar and saving Jinora, Lin allowed Korra and Mako to enter the Spirit Wilds, though urged them to be careful.\n" +
            "Before they could leave, however, Lin's presence as Republic City's Chief of Police was required at the city's Spirit Wilds, which had turned hostile and had abducted people. She ordered her officers to clear the area, put up a perimeter, and cancel all tours through the wilds. Since Jinora was among the vegetations' victims, she also ordered for someone to contact Tenzin. When Korra and Mako approached her, desiring to go into the wilds to save Jinora, Lin stated that she did not believe it was safe for anyone to venture into the spirit forest. After a vine shot out of the vegetation, emphasizing the danger the trapped people were in, Lin relented and allowed Korra to enter, though urged her to be careful.\n" +
            "After witnessing Jinora, Ryu, and the other tourists safely exit the Spirit Wilds, Lin retreated to Air Temple Island, where she helped Opal to prepare Juicy for their departure to Zaofu. As she loaded the last of the supplies on top of the animal, Bolin approached Opal and came along on their mission.[30]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As they arrived at Zaofu, Lin ordered Bolin to stop babbling dramatically of how he would save the Beifongs and his relationship with Opal, noting that she had already heard enough of that during their journey. Surveying the area, she noted that Kuvira had an entire battalion of troops stationed outside of the city, though realized that if they wanted to find their family, they needed to get inside Zaofu. Much to her surprise, she found her plan rejected as useless by her mother, who remarked that all the prisoners had been moved. Baffled, she greeted Toph as \"chief\" and was in return acknowledged in the same fashion. When Bolin started to squeal due to being in Toph's presence, Lin placed a hand to her temple, severely annoyed with the young man's antics. Attributing his babbling to him being an actor, Lin asked her mother how she knew Suyin had been captured and learned that she had kept an eye on Zaofu via the vines of the Foggy Swamp. After Toph added that their family had already been moved to a prison camp and Bolin pinpointed its location to be that of a nearby factory and reeducation facility, the all boarded Juicy and moved out.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toph and Lin\n" +
            "Lin harbored a grudge toward her mother for never revealing any personal information in regards to the identity of her father.\n" +
            "En route to the factory, Lin specified to Bolin that her mother's mention of a \"little while now, couple years\" since she had seen Lin was in fact twenty years. When Toph changed the subject to her wonder that Lin had come to save Suyin, Lin revealed that she and Suyin had worked out their grievances with each other, though when Toph joyously noted that she was glad they could put that behind them, Lin scowled at the idea, harboring a grudge toward her mother.\n" +
            "Arriving at the factory, they all sneaked in and when Toph used her seismic sense to deduce Suyin and her family were being kept in a cavern underneath the factory, as she could sense the mecha tanks, Lin verified her claim, confirming the presence of soldiers guarding a seemingly empty cavern. Not sensing their family, she deduced that they were kept in a suspended prison that prevented them from earthbending. When Kuvira entered the hangar, they all hid and overheard her conversation with Baatar Jr. and Zhu Li. Retreating to the hills surrounding the facility, the foursome decided to postpone their rescue mission until the next day after Bolin reasoned that the most ideal moment to strike would be during the testing of the spirit energy cannon, since Kuvira desired to have all the troops and workers present, which would leave the factory mostly deserted.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Lin annoyed with Toph\n" +
            "As she had not spoken with Toph for twenty years, Lin had a lot of unresolved issues with her mother, specifically in regards to the identity of her father.\n" +
            "During dinner, Lin kept a distant attitude while Bolin and Toph talked. She sarcastic jabbed that Toph was indeed a \"real sensitive instructor\", when her mother stated that even a \"blockhead\" like Bolin could have learned metalbending given the right instruction, and scoffed at their conversation, noting that Toph was \"real encouraging\", when she had complimenting Bolin on the possibility of being talented after all. As Bolin asked Toph who Lin's father was, Lin shot him a dirty look and after her mother casually answered that he was a nice man named Kanto with whom it did not work out, she was ordered to say whatever it was she wanted to say so they could \"get it over with\", since Toph could sense her daughter's \"enraged breathing\". Infuriated even more by that comment, Lin snapped at Toph that growing up without a father and never even discussing him weighed heavily on her. She added that she had entertained the thought of reaching out to her after having reconciled with Suyin, though concluded that now they were together again, she remembered why they had stopped talking in the first place, since Toph infuriated her and did not know or care why. She declared to not wanting anything more to do with her after they had saved Suyin, a decision Toph solemnly accepted if that was what made her happy.\n" +
            "Liberation of the Beifong family\n" +
            "With the assistance of Toph and Bolin, Lin managed to free Suyin and her family.\n" +
            "The following day, after Opal alerted them that the demonstration was about to start, Lin, Toph, and Bolin burrowed themselves a tunnel toward the underground cavern where the Beifong family was being held captive. Toph and Bolin catapulted Lin atop the cell, where she fashioned a blade out of her armor and cut a hole in the wood through which the prisoners could escape. Using her cables, she swung her nephews over to Toph and Bolin, where the latter would catch them to ensure a safe landing. Everything went well, until the acrophobic Baatar refused to leave the prison and requested to be left behind, forcing Lin to forcefully grab hold of him and swing him over to Bolin. His screams alerted the guards to their presence and although she and Suyin managed to exit the cell in time, they were too late to swing to safety by the cables themselves and were attacked by a mecha suit. To escape, Lin cut two of the ropes suspending the prison and grabbed a hold of Suyin, pulling her out of the way of a flamethrower attack and letting the entire structure swing toward the other side of the chasm. Right before they would slam against the wall, the two sisters jumped inside the tunnel, where the rest of their family was waiting for them.\n" +
            "Beifongs versus Earth Empire soldiers\n" +
            "Despite their fierce resistance, Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing found themselves surrounded and outnumbered by Kuvira's soldiers.\n" +
            "Resurfacing and reuniting with Opal, Lin urged them all to move out. When Bolin learned that Zhu Li had been chained up in the abandoned town that was to be blown up by the cannon and wanted to save her, Lin tried to reason with him that it was too dangerous now that they had been discovered. After Bolin and Opal left on Juicy to the town, Lin agreed with Suyin that it was possibly their best chance to take down Kuvira and destroy the cannon. As such, she left with her, Wei, and Wing toward the testing area. Just as the spirit energy cannon fired its deadly beam at the abandoned town to which Opal and Bolin had traveled, they used their earthbending to rattle the piece of artillery, distorting the beam's trajectory and causing it to miss the town. Working with her sister and nephews, Lin barraged Kuvira's soldiers with rocks and boulders. While Suyin left to battle Kuvira one-on-one, Lin and the twins erected a protective barrier around them. She lowered the shield to allow Wing to reel in Wei after he had gone to save Suyin, though soon found their entire defensive circle being brought down by Kuvira's troops. Although Lin prepared to continue fighting, she found herself outnumbered and surrounded. Before the battle could proceed, however, they were saved by Toph, who shifted the earth underneath the feet of their aggressors, bringing them all down. As Opal returned on Juicy, Lin escaped to safety with the rest of her family, Bolin, and Zhu Li.\n" +
            "Toph and Lin reconciling\n" +
            "Both apologizing for their mistakes, Lin reconciled with Toph.\n" +
            "Landing in a bamboo forest, Lin thanked her mother for having come to her rescue and apologized for all she had said the previous night. When Toph acknowledged that she had not been the best mother, though was nonetheless proud of the women her daughters had become, hoping they could find it in their hearts to not hate her, Lin accepted her words and embraced her mother. Their moment was ruined by Bolin, however, who joined in on their hug, while emphasizing the importance of family. Neither woman appreciated his intervention and Lin shoved him back after Toph had freed herself from his embrace. After her mother started on her journey back to the swamp, Lin was shocked to hear Zhu Li report that Kuvira planned to attack Republic City two weeks later.[5]\n" +
            "Defending Republic City\n" +
            "Having returned to Republic City, Lin, Suyin, Bolin, and Zhu Li immediately set course for City Hall, where they interrupted a meeting between President Raiko, Avatar Korra, Prince Wu, Mako, and Tenzin. After Zhu Li announced that Kuvira planned to attack two weeks later, Lin stated that she expected Kuvira to come via the rail lines, reasoning she would need them to transport her heavy spirit energy cannon, prompting Korra and Raiko to agree to cut them.\n" +
            "Wu calming Republic City down\n" +
            "Lin was impressed with Wu's calming speech to the people of Republic City.\n" +
            "After Raiko made the evacuation of the city mandatory, Lin, Mako, and Wu traveled toward the police headquarters, where Mako inadvertently started a panic among the citizens by alerting them via the emergency broadcast line of the imminent attack on the city and confusing them with the evacuation instructions, much to Lin's annoyance. As Wu took over, she was impressed with how he managed to calm the people down and stop the influx of calls, noting that he would make a good king after all.\n" +
            "A week later, Lin reasoned with Raiko that Air Temple Island was the ideal location for his base of operations and he would be safe there. When Team Avatar revealed the next day that Kuvira's arrival was only hours away and a week ahead of schedule, Lin was ordered to contact General Iroh and alert him of the new developments, as they needed to lock down the city.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Retreating to the tower, Lin and Raiko were shocked to witness the arrival of the enormous mecha suit carrying the spirit energy cannon, despite having been briefed about its size. After Kuvira used her cannon to sink the United Forces battleships in a matter of seconds and aimed the weapon at the United Forces ground troops, threatening to kill them, Raiko sadly told Lin that he had no choice but to surrendered the city.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Lin and Raiko awaited the arrival of Baatar Jr. at Air Temple Island together, though when the crew of his airship continued to whisper among themselves, Lin called them out on it and they revealed that they did not know where Baatar Jr. was.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Moments later, Lin witnessed how Kuvira blew up the Future Industries factory where Avatar Korra, Suyin, and their allies were located. She promptly ordered Officer Song to keep the president safe, while she left to check for survivors.[31]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Preparing for battle\n" +
            "While Asami and Varrick adjusted the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits, Lin and the other benders decided to take on Kuvira and her army by themselves.\n" +
            "Arriving at the ruins of the factory, Lin was pleased to find that everyone had made it out and readily agreed with Korra that the world was not safe as long as Kuvira wielded the spirit energy cannon, declaring they had to take down the enormous mecha suit that day. While Asami and Varrick attempted to adapt the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits in Asami's office to get them airborne, she and the other benders faced Kuvira and her army in an attempt to stop them or at the very least, slow them down. As they ran past a paint store in the city, Lin asked Meelo what he was doing after he blew down the door of the establishment, only to be informed that he had just thought of a way to take on the enormous mecha suit.\n" +
            "Lin, Wei, Wing, Bolin, and Mako watched in worry from the cover of an alley how the airbenders assaulted Kuvira's machine with paint balloons, covering its windows and obscuring the vision of the pilots. Upon Tenzin's signal, Lin used her cables to fling herself on the mecha suit's right foot and attempted to bend its joints, though soon discovered that they too were made out of platinum, which was impervious to her bending. When Kuvira shot her cannon at the airbenders who had attempted to blow the suit off balance, Lin rushed to Opal's side, who had been rendered unconscious due to being knocked down by the energy emanating from the beam that nearly hit her.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Lin and Suyin earthbending together\n" +
            "Working together with Suyin and Bolin, Lin toppled a building atop Kuvira's enormous mecha suit.\n" +
            "While the others retreated to Asami's office, Lin made her way toward Republic City prison and released Hiroshi Sato from his cell. Taking him back to Future Industries Tower, she explained to everyone that he, as a genius engineer, could help them with their attempts to bring Kuvira down, though emphasized to Hiroshi that he would be incarcerated again as soon as the battle was over if the prison was still standing. With his help, a new plan was formed: the benders would once again try to stall Kuvira's advance, while Asami, Hiroshi, Varrick, and Zhu Li equipped the hummingbird mecha suits with plasma saws and, as soon as the suits were operational, the benders would relentlessly attack the mecha suit to distract Kuvira and enable the two hummingbird mecha suits to land on the enormous machine and cut a hole in it without being crushed. As such, while standing atop a building and working together with Suyin and Bolin, Lin severed the top stories of a large building and toppled it on Kuvira's mecha suit. While the machine was buried under the rubble, she used her metal cables to lower herself back to the street, where Korra, Wei, and Wing where awaiting them; they were all shocked, however, to discover that the mecha suit uncovered itself without so much as a scratch. As Kuvira resumed her rampage, Lin saw the metal cables of her nephews being severed by an energy beam, causing them to plummet down, and instantly made her way over to them, catching the two before they crashed to the ground. She was subsequently saved herself from being crushed by falling debris by Suyin, who erected an earth tent for cover. After Hiroshi Sato was crushed to death by Kuvira upon completing his mission of cutting a hole in the suit's armor, Lin grabbed a hold of Bolin and rappelled them both atop the machine with her metal cables. As Korra used her waterbending to prevent the mecha suit from crushing them, Lin managed to dive inside the hole together with Suyin, Bolin, Mako, and Korra.[32]\n" +
            "Lin and Suyin metalbending\n" +
            "Together with Suyin, Lin destroyed the loading mechanism of Kuvira's spirit energy cannon from within.\n" +
            "Inside, Lin was ordered by Korra to climb up to the weaponized arm together with Suyin and disable the spirit energy cannon. While Bolin and Mako headed toward the engine room and Korra would take on Kuvira, the Beifong sisters used their cables to quickly ascend toward the right arm of the machine. Upon arrival, they were immediately attacked by a guard, who barraged them with metal strips. While ripping a plate from the wall and use it as cover, Lin ordered her sister to disable the weapon while she would take care of the guard. She resolutely jumped down to the platform of her adversary and bent two metal sword out of the wrists of her uniform; she used those to knock aside the incoming projectiles, before retracting them in favor of her cable. After trading some punches with the other metalbender, she managed to overpower her and made her way back to Suyin, complimenting her on having torn down the cannon's loading mechanism, causing the spirit vine power cores to explode within the arm. As Suyin noted that although the outside of the mecha suit was constructed out of platinum, the inside was metallic, making it vulnerable to their metalbending, the sisters worked together to cause as much damage as they could, effectively disabling the weapon and severing Kuvira's connection to the arm as a whole. They were roughly thrown against the metal wall, however, as Kuvira ripped the now useless arm off the suit and tossed it away; Lin saved Suyin and herself from being flung free by bending the interior wall around them to strap them in, though was rendered unconscious by the shock caused when the arm crashed into a building.\n" +

            "Lin handcuffed Kuvira after she surrendered and led her away with Suyin, so the Earth Empire commander could be held responsible for her actions.\n" +
            "After they recovered, Lin and Suyin made their way to the Spirit Wilds, which had been blasted open when Kuvira had fired the spirit energy cannon from within the vegetation and now housed a new spirit portal. Realizing Korra and Kuvira were nowhere to be found, Lin and the rest of Team Avatar set out to search the area for the Avatar. She watched in surprise when the spirits emerged a few moments later from the spirit portal, followed by Korra and Kuvira. After Kuvira surrendered, Lin handcuffed her and led her away with Suyin's help.\n" +
            "Lin later attended Zhu Li and Varrick's wedding on Air Temple Island, sitting between Tenzin and Suyin; although she smiled when the couple sealed their union with a kiss, she did not applaud like the other guests. During the dinner party, Lin stood by herself on the side and took one of the offered food sticks, though eyed it warily.[33]\n" +

            "Much like her mother, Lin is quite comfortable letting others know when she is displeased.\n" +
            "On the surface, Lin is tough, uncompromising, and blunt. As Chief of Police, she has a no-nonsense attitude, apprehending anyone who breaks the law, regardless of position, familial relationship or intent; as such, she was quick to arrest her own sister after being involved in a robbery and condemn the Avatar when she destroyed public and private property in an attempt to apprehend the three Triple Threat Triad members by herself. Lin believes that the only way to maintain peace and stability in Republic City is through the use of military might and treats the city's laws with great respect, enforcing them with unyielding ferocity, even to the point where she felt the Avatar's presence could potentially compromise the city's safety.[34]\n" +
            "Much of her uptight and guarded personality stemmed from her frustrations with her mother, whose uninvolved parenting style and continuous refusal to disclose the identity of her father or even discuss anything related to him greatly infuriated Lin.[5] This, combined with her belief that Suyin's rebellious personality brought dishonor to their name[1] and her breakup with Tenzin, made Lin seemingly put up a barrier to ignore the pain of personal relationships going awry, making others describe her as \"challenging\"[10] and a bitter loner who kept her grievances to herself.[6]\n" +

            "Lin apologized to Opal and opened up to the young airbender, revealing a more compassionate aspect of her character.\n" +
            "Despite her seemingly indifferent exterior, Lin has a softer facet to her personality. Following the battle at the Pro-bending Arena, Lin became less harsh toward Tenzin and Korra.[4] Despite initially struggling to do so, she was also not above opening up during intimate moments, as evidenced when she had a private talk with Opal, openly disclosing her hostile history with her mother. Immediately after, Lin assumed the role of the encouraging aunt for her niece, suggesting her niece should hone her new airbending skills under Tenzin's tutelage.[1] Lin also inherited her mother's candid sense of humor and sarcasm, being comfortable to express her displeasure, such as when she congratulated Korra for instigating the Water Tribe Civil War,[35] chastised Korra for leaving her at Zaofu, and when Naga licked her in joy.[24]\n" +
            "Lin was incredibly loyal and selfless to her friends and allies, to the point where she would willingly sacrifice herself and her goals to help them in their time of need. She forfeited her chance to capture Amon to save Avatar Korra's life[4] and accepted Tenzin's request to help protect his family without hesitation, for whom she let herself be captured in an attempt to secure their escape. When she was given the chance to sell Korra out to keep her bending, she blatantly refused.[36] After patching things up with Suyin,[1] Lin's display of heroism extended to her sister and her family, going as far as embarking an unsanctioned mission to save them after being held captive by Kuvira.[30]\n" +

            "Abilities\n" +
            "Earthbending\n" +
            "Like her renowned mother, Lin has mastered earthbending to a similar level. She is equally proficient in the traditional Hung Gar earthbending style and her mother's self-taught Chu Gar Praying Mantis style. She is able to easily elevate multiple large boulders simultaneously, as well as launch herself high up into the air.\n" +
            "Lin using seismic sense\n" +
            "Lin used seismic sense to detect Hiroshi Sato's secret workshop.\n" +
            "Lin has also demonstrated a great mastery over the seismic sense technique, which allows her to detect the layout of the surrounding area and the people within it with great accuracy and detail. Thus, she is easily able to locate subterranean structures, as well as determine with accuracy who is within the general vicinity. For example, while on the hunt for her captured officers, she was able to pinpoint their presence within an Equalist hideout, but also perceive that Korra was absent. She could also sense the mechanism of a locked door without physically perceiving it in order to open it with her bending. Like Toph, Lin's ability is limited without direct skin contact, requiring her to either use her hands or retract the soles on her boots.\n" +
            "Metalbending\n" +
            "Lin stopping the Equalists\n" +
            "Lin used metalbending to destroy an Equalist airship.\n" +
            "As the chief of the Metalbending Police Force, Lin is especially proficient in the specialized art of metalbending. She is able to rip metal beams or floors from their bearings and single-handedly tear apart an airship's metal hull. For more general use, Lin uses her standard retractable metal cables, which are highly versatile in battle. With them, she is able to perform considerable feats of acrobatics, easily maneuvering around cavernous locations, such as the Pro-bending Arena. She can also fashion them as wrist blades for close-quarters combat. Lin has also performed intricate and otherwise delicate metalbending as well, from unlocking metal handcuffs from a distance to wrapping her armor around herself, and even closing up Bolin's zipper.[14] Despite all this, her mother, Toph, did not believe Lin picked up all the specifics of metalbending.[29]\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Despite being middle-aged, Lin is agile and resilient; this was exhibited through her quick recovery from a chi blocker attack and, in the same move, somersaulting upright and taking down two chi blockers. She was likewise still able to effectively maneuver and fight on par with Suyin despite being visibly exhausted at the time. Her reflexes are great enough that she can subdue multiple chi blockers by herself. She has also shown considerable skill in aim, as she was able to snap Tarrlok's gavel from across a large room with one of her metal cables without touching him with the cable. Lin is also a capable driver and pilot, being able to navigate a police car through crowded streets in pursuit of the Terra Triad and man an airship by herself.\n" +
            "Despite not being able to see through Varrick's ruse during the Water Tribe Civil War,[16] Lin possesses decent detective skills, making her a valuable member of the police force. She also put her skills to use to track down Team Avatar after they left Zaofu to chase Zaheer\n";

Once an honored admiral of the Fire Nation Navy, he disagreed with Fire Lord Ozai's oppressive and cruel way of ruling, and defected from the military. He was the first person to desert the Fire Nation military and live to tell the tale. Because of this, he came to be known as \"The Deserter\" and was regarded as a legend. He relocated to the Earth Kingdom, where he encountered a small tribe who became his travel companions.[3] As a member of the Order of the White Lotus, he aided in the liberation of Ba Sing Se.[4]\n" +

            "History\n" +
            "Early life, career, and desertion\n" +
            "From a young age, Jeong Jeong was recognized by his teachers as a firebending prodigy, and through diligent study and practice, he became a master in his teenage years. He eventually joined the navy and taught firebending to young soldiers, one of whom was Zhao. The future Admiral, however, did not acknowledge the dangers of firebending, concerning himself only with using the art to destroy his opponents and neglecting to learn the discipline that came with it. After many years of watching his students wage war and cause destruction, Jeong Jeong began to question his own teachings.[5]\n" +
            "Ten years before he met Avatar Aang, Jeong Jeong deserted the Fire Nation Navy and vowed never to teach firebending again. Under constant pursuit by the military, he was forced to move from place-to-place, never settling in one area for more than a season. Years after his defection, Jeong Jeong came in contact with a tribe in the northwestern Earth Kingdom, and was declared a living god. They offered him residence at a small camp, where he stayed during the winter.[3]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Aang's firebending master\n" +
            "When Aang was brought by Chey to Jeong Jeong's camp in order to learn firebending,[1] Jeong Jeong was furious, since it was clear to him that Aang was not interested in learning discipline, and had not learned waterbending or earthbending. He said that because Aang had not learned how to master these elements, he lacked the disciplinary principles which would aid him in controlling the power of firebending, and thus refused to even see him. Defiantly, Aang sought out Jeong Jeong in a small hut, where he was meditating surrounded by candles, and next to a dead tree.\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong and Aang\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong initially refused to teach Aang firebending.\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong reiterated his refusal and remarked on Aang's lack of discipline, referring to him as too weak. The flames of the candles around him flared intensely before extinguishing completely and the master had a vision where he found himself to be elsewhere with only one candle lit in front of him and a tree behind him. Avatar Roku appeared before him, asking whether Jeong Jeong thought the old Avatar was weak. After the deserter regretted implying that, Roku ordered him to teach the Avatar firebending. As Jeong Jeong reluctantly agreed, he was back in his room with Aang, who was pleased to hear the old master's decision.\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong's teaching techniques rested heavily on discipline. Before he taught Aang how to firebend, he made Aang train using several techniques, hoping the young Avatar could avoid hurting anyone. Jeong Jeong instructed Aang to do breathing exercises for several hours, however, Aang quickly became impatient. The Avatar's impatience greatly angered the master, who used Zhao, his former student, as an example of what could happen to one who did not learn the discipline associated with firebending. Aang quickly apologized and said that he was ready to comply with Jeong Jeong's orders.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong firebends\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong raised a fire wall to stop Zhao and his forces.\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong proceeded to instruct Aang in actual firebending, much to Aang's excitement. He was disappointed, however, when Jeong Jeong assigned him the simple task of preventing a leaf from being completely burned. Jeong Jeong returned to find Katara's hands burnt because Aang attempted firebending on his own, and watched as she healed her burns. He informed Katara about her newfound ability, and said that healing was a much better power to have than burning. Shortly thereafter, Zhao and his men sailed up river toward Jeong Jeong's encampment in pursuit of the Avatar. Zhao was instead confronted by Jeong Jeong, who raised a wall of fire that stretched from the clearing of the riverbanks and across the river itself. The ships' progress was hindered; however, Zhao, aware of his former masters' reluctance to fight, was not deterred and simply walked through the wall of flames.\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong dissipated the wall completely, leaving no trace of wild fire to spread and harm the surrounding environment. Aang subsequently arrived at the scene, and with a grin, Jeong Jeong conjured up an immense mass of flames and disappeared, leaving Aang to deal with Zhao and his men.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Liberation of Ba Sing Se\n" +
            "Before the liberation of Ba Sing Se, Jeong Jeong answered the call of Grand Lotus Iroh and gathered at the White Lotus camp in preparation of the upcoming battle. When Sozin's Comet arrived, Jeong Jeong used the power of comet to increase his firebending and fend off multiple tundra tanks that were attempting to defend the city.[4]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong meditating\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong often meditated alone in order to achieve inner peace.\n" +
            "Although Jeong Jeong was a firebending master, he had conflicted feelings about the bending art, referring to it as a \"burning curse\". He admitted in a conversation with Katara that he had always wished that he was a waterbender, since water is considered the element of healing, whereas firebending \"brings only destruction and pain\". His bitterness over his own ability has been repeatedly demonstrated by his behavior and character. Rarely smiling, Jeong Jeong preferred to be alone in order to not harm others, but also because he seemed disappointed with the world. As an enlightened and embittered man, he often meditated alone and in the darkness, reflecting his dark view of the world and his firebending. He believed he could suppress his \"burning curse\" in this way.\n" +
            "However, in contrast, he referred to the sun as the greatest source of fire as it is in perfect harmony with nature. Jeong Jeong's technique seemed to reflect this quality by being both overwhelmingly powerful and non-destructive.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Prior to the start of the liberation of Ba Sing Se, Jeong Jeong seemed more at peace with himself and the world.[4]\n" +

            "Wave of fire\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong demonstrated a mastery of firebending.\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong was a master firebender, a former prodigy who was later recognized throughout the Fire Nation as a genius in its usage. However, his approach to fighting was conservative, as he preferred to use the defensive side of his bending. He believed firebending to be a curse, a dangerous power that, generally, only causes destruction; thus, his style emphasized self-control, precision, and patience. His teachings to Aang demonstrated his philosophy of discipline, for Jeong Jeong believed that many firebenders, such as Fire Lord Ozai and Admiral Zhao, drew all of their power from their anger and thus easily lost control of the flames. His own style was focused on slow development and constant return to the basics, which he made a point to impart to Aang. Nonetheless, Jeong Jeong demonstrated later that this attitude does not equate with weak or unsure firebending, but rather the opposite.\n" +
            "Although he did not demonstrate many of his abilities, Jeong Jeong seemed to specialize in the creation of walls of fire and large blasts. He first used the former to fend off Zhao's river boats, controlling the wall so precisely the flames could burn on water as well as not endanger the nature of the surrounding area. Subsequently, he created a ball of fire that fended off four simultaneous fire blasts, and provided a distraction for him to flee.[1] Later on, he was depicted surrounding an Aang-less Team Avatar with a large wall of fire.[4] In addition, during the battle for Ba Sing Se Jeong Jeong's control of firebending became apparent once more when he created several fire walls to only push tundra tanks back, rather than melting them.[6] This ability corresponded with his belief that firebending can be dangerous if not controlled.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong&#039;s jet propulsion\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong had the ability to suspend himself in the air with firebending while simultaneously producing powerful firewalls.\n" +
            "He was able to keep himself suspended in the air, by extending a jet of fire below his feet.[6] His technique was different from Ozai's in that Jeong Jeong seemed to levitate rather than fly, and could execute other large firebending techniques without needing to land or cut off his propulsion.\n" +
            "His control of fire walls showed a similar aspect with the waterbending Jeong Jeong seemed to envy so much, as he created the fire walls resembling rising tides to push tanks away like tidal waves do naturally.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Jeong Jeong's master firebending ultimately stemmed from his keen and experienced mind, as he was able to tell just from looking that Aang had not mastered waterbending and earthbending, thus making him unready to learn firebending.[1] Better defined by his love for nature and acceptance of other cultures, Jeong Jeong had also achieved enlightenment, and was in tune with spirituality, much like Iroh. He demonstrated this attitude when he reluctantly obeyed Avatar Roku, who appeared to him in a vision, after being asked to teach Aang firebending.\n";

During his youth, he met a young firebender named P'Li, whom he saved from the clutches of a warlord intending to make her his personal assassin. Following this, Zaheer convinced P'Li to join the ranks of the Red Lotus.[3] In 158 AG, Unalaq, a fellow Red Lotus member, devised a plan to kidnap Korra which Zaheer supported, as they intended to use her to re-open the spirit portals and free Vaatu, while at the same time training her in bending and the ways of the Red Lotus. Although Unalaq ultimately did not go through with the attempted abduction and remained undiscovered,[1] Zaheer, Ghazan, P'Li, and Ming-Hua went on with his plan, though were defeated and imprisoned by Tenzin, Tonraq, Zuko, and Sokka.

Two weeks after Harmonic Convergence ended, he took advantage of his newfound abilities and waited to attempt his escape until his guards came to bring him his bowl of rice. With the metal covering of his cell door open, he was ordered to face the wall with his hands upon his head. As his food was being placed in his cell through an opening in the bars, Zaheer recited one of Laghima's poem verses and after explaining the meaning of the writing, he used his airbending to pull one guard against the cell bars, where he restrained him, effectively preventing the others from attacking lest they killed that guard. He opened his cell door with the keys taken from the guard's waist and used his airbending to defeat and jail all of the other guards. Zaheer cautioned them to ration the bowl of rice they had brought him, as the next shift change was three weeks away, and announced the dawn of a new age, one in which there would be no Order of the White Lotus or Avatar. Using his airbending skills, he swiftly made his way down the mountain, seeking to liberate his incarcerated comrades.[2]\n" +

            "Zaheer managed to disguise himself as a White Lotus member and stole a speedboat, which he used to make his way to Ghazan's prison. There, he fought off White Lotus sentries and supplied his friend with a few rocks to help him escape. After Ghazan used his lavabending to release himself from his cell and dispatched the remaining guards, the two friends heartily greeted each other. Upon asked how he became an airbender, Zaheer explained that he believed it was a gift, bestowed upon him after Harmonic Convergence, to indicate that their path was the righteous one. Afterward, the duo journeyed to the volcano in which Ming-Hua's prison was located, intent on freeing her. Once they were within range of the waterbender's cage, Zaheer sliced the barrel of water that Ghazan had thrown in the air in half, enabling Ming-Hua to utilize it to escape. After the threesome took care of the remaining sentries, Zaheer announced that they would head to the Northern Water Tribe in order to free P'Li.[4]\n" +

The new airbender evaded all of the chief's attacks, before knocking him down with an air blast. After P'Li was freed by Ming-Hua, the four criminals made a clean getaway. Happy to see each other again, Zaheer and P'Li embraced, the airbender saying he never doubted he would see her again, before sharing a kiss.[7]\n" +

He explained to Ikki and Meelo that he had heard about the island being a sanctuary for airbenders, demonstrating his newly discovered abilities by creating a small tornado in his hand.\n" +
            "Zaheer subsequently joined the airbending training with Meelo at the spinning gates, where he passed through them with ease, surprising everyone. Earning the compliment of being a leaf from Meelo, Zaheer returned the courtesy by bowing respectfully toward the child, saying that a student was only as good as his master. When Kya announced that they would leave the following day to join Tenzin at the Northern Air Temple, Zaheer asked if the Avatar was with him. Learning she had split from Tenzin, he took the news as \"unfortunate\", as he had been \"looking forward to meeting her\".\n" +

            "That night, Zaheer wandered into Tenzin's study, where he found a locket containing a poem written by Guru Laghima. He was interrupted by Ikki, who stated that no one but her father was allowed in the study. Zaheer apologized, stating he could not sleep, and when asked by the young airbender what he was reading, he explained that it was a poem of Laghima, whom he credited as the wisest airbender to have ever lived. Their conversation was cut short by the arrival of Kya, who told her niece to go back to bed, before questioning Zaheer about his knowledge of airbending history. He replied that he had always admired the culture, though Kya recognized him and attacked. Zaheer grabbed an airbender staff and used it to shatter the ice bullets aimed at him before bending himself out of the window and gliding away. His escape was short lived, however, as Kya managed to catch him with a water tentacle and slam him down in the temple's pond. Recovering, Zaheer managed to avoid being frozen and blasted Kya back, though before he could escape, two firebending White Lotus sentries arrived. By the time he had done away with them, Kya was back on her feet attacked him with spirals of water. Ducking away, the airbender retaliated with a strong current of air, knocking Kya out cold against a wall, and escaped on the glider.[8]\n" +

            "Zaheer regrouped with the Red Lotus at a vine-covered apartment in Republic City, hiding from the Metalbending Police Force. When asked by Ghazan if he wanted to try to take out President Raiko, Zaheer stated they would deal with him later as they were leaving the city. Hijacking a truck and forcing the driver to smuggle them out of the city, they made it as far as at a security checkpoint on a bridge, where they were discovered after their driver ran away. As one of the police officers turned the handle on the back doors of the vehicle, Zaheer blasted them open to keep the police back, while Ming-Hua drove away, with Ghazan and P'Li taking care of their pursuers. Taking refuge in a forest, Zaheer meditated and determined that the Avatar was with the Metal Clan in Zaofu.[9]\n" +

            "Zaheer and his gang traveled to the metal city and, with the help of Aiwei, were able to enter Suyin Beifong's estate without being noticed. Having cut an opening in the window to Korra's room, they were caught by Naga, who tried to attack. Although Ming-Hua bent three shirshu-spit darts into the polar bear dog to quiet her, Korra awoke to the sound of Naga falling and attacked, prompting Zaheer to quickly bend another paralyzing dart at her as well. With the Avatar in tow, the group began to escape, but ended up boxed in by metal plates in the estate's courtyard after Mako and Bolin alerted the Metal Clan to their presence. After Ghazan created a lava moat, melting the plates and creating a distance between the two groups, Zaheer attempted to use the smoke coming from the moat to create some cover by spinning his staff over his head. However, this motion enabled one of the guards to reel him in with a metal cable. Although he managed to free himself, he was forced to take on two metalbenders. When he noticed that Suyin and Lin Beifong had managed to save Korra, he attempted to pursue, though found himself grounded after Suyin pierced the wings of his glider with four metal arrows. Landing near his friends, he angrily declared their mission a failure and used the smoke to cover their retreat.[10]\n" +
            "Explaining his motives\n" +
            "Zaheer and his companions made camp in a cave located at the outskirts of the Misty Palms Oasis, where he meditated into the Spirit World at sundown to meet Aiwei at Xai Bau's Grove. He blamed the truth seer for the Red Lotus' failure at Zaofu and the fact that they had now been compromised. Although Aiwei assured him that all incriminating evidence had been destroyed, Zaheer labeled Aiwei to be a loose end himself. As he grabbed him, Zaheer noticed Korra's presence, though before the Avatar could do something, the airbender teleported to the Fog of Lost Souls, where he condemned the truth seer to an eternity in the mental prison. Returning to Xai Bau's Grove, he learned that Korra had tracked him down by following Aiwei and offered her a chance to talk and find some answers. He revealed that he and his companions were members of the Red Lotus and told the Avatar of the organization's origin and purpose. Meanwhile, in the physical world, he secretly revealed Korra's location at the Misty Palms Inn to his associates, who were guarding his body.\n" +
            "Zaheer reveals the Red Lotus mission\n" +
            "Zaheer distracted Korra by giving her the option to have an open conversation, resulting in a talk about the origin and goals of the Red Lotus.\n" +
            "In the Spirit World, Zaheer kept the conversation with Korra going by elaborating on Unalaq's idea to kidnap her as a child, which was meant to bring balance to the world as she would have been used to re-open the spirit portals and release Vaatu. Rebuffing Korra's statement that they had different ideas of balance, Zaheer suggested that opening the spirit portals should only be the beginning, as the idea of separating the world in nations and governments was as foolish as separating the human from the spirit realm. He pointed out that she had already had to deal with a \"moronic president\" and a \"tyrannical queen\" and reminded the doubtful Avatar that it had been the Fire Lord's ambition for world dominance that had led to the Air Nomad Genocide. Stating the natural order to be disorder, he believed that true freedom could only be achieved when oppressive governments were dismantled and cited another one of Guru Laghima's sayings to emphasize his point: \"New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old.\" Zaheer went on to explain he had begun to lose hope during his imprisonment, though when he had discovered his airbending abilities, he was strengthened in his belief that he was the one who could usher in the new era. He warned Korra that once change began, it could not be stopped. At her request to know what would happen if she was captured, he merely told her she would have her answer soon enough, assuming his accomplices to have captured her body by that point, and vanished.\n" +
            "Upon his return to the physical world, Zaheer was informed by Ming-Hua and Ghazan that Earth Queen Hou-Ting's army had gotten to the Avatar first, though that they had managed to capture Mako and Bolin. Zaheer instructed them to load the brothers in the truck, telling them they were going to Ba Sing Se.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Toppling the Earth Queen\n" +
            "Zaheer persuading the Queen\n" +
            "Zaheer managed to persuade Earth Queen Hou-Ting to trade Avatar Korra for information regarding the new airbenders.\n" +
            "Arriving at Ba Sing Se, Zaheer ordered Ghazan to gag Mako and Bolin. Upon gaining an audience with Earth Queen Hou-Ting, Zaheer assured her they wanted no bounty and that the brothers were merely a \"thank you\" gift for her taking time to talk to them. Zaheer used the location of the \"stolen\" airbenders as a bargaining chip to trade with the Queen for Korra, as he reasoned that that if she were to imprison the Avatar, she would invoke the wrath of the other nations, whereas if she handed Korra over to him, no one needed to know and she would still be rid of the Avatar while being able to get her airbenders back with no interference. With a deal having been reached, the four were escorted to an antechamber by Grand Secretariat Gun.\n" +
            "As the group relaxed, Zaheer noticed a Dai Li agent moving rapidly toward the queen's throne room. Intrigued, he used his airbending to secretly follow him and he overheard the agent telling Hou-Ting that the airship transporting Korra had crashed in the Si Wong Desert. Relaying the information to the others upon his return, it became clear that they would not be able to get to Korra before the Queen and Zaheer decided that he was through chasing her, declaring that it was time to make Korra come to them.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Zaheer taking down Hou-Ting\n" +
            "Zaheer used his airbending to suffocate Earth Queen Hou-Ting and end her reign over the Earth Kingdom.\n" +
            "Zaheer blasted open the doors to the throne room and told the queen of their disappointment regarding the news on Korra. Deeming their eavesdropping actions to be punishable with imprisonment, the Red Lotus was offered the chance to evade arrest if they would give up the location of the airbenders. When Zaheer warned her that was not the deal, a fight ensued between them and the Dai Li, who were ordered to imprison them all. After the group easily defeated the earthbenders, Zaheer confronted the now defenseless queen. Stating he did not believe in queens, he used his airbending to pull the air from her lungs. While suffocating her in a sphere devoid of air, he told her that freedom was not something she could give or take on a whim, but that is was just as essential as air to her people and that without it, there was no life, only darkness. He emphasized his words by using his airbending to suck the breath from the Queen's lungs, asphyxiating her.\n" +
            "With the queen murdered, Zaheer, Ming-Hua, and P'Li went to the city's radio control room, asking the operator how he could make an announcement to the city. As the man did not immediately cooperate, Ming-Hua grabbed him with a water tendril, prompting Zaheer to tell her to let go, as their goal was to help citizens like him. After the operator turned on the radio, Zaheer told the citizens that he and other revolutionaries had brought down the queen. Without revealing his identity, he simply told the people he was returning the city in their hands, as he believed they had no need for leaders telling them what to do and were free to find their own path.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Afterward, Zaheer ventured to the prison underneath the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace and released all the prisoners, save for Mako and Bolin. After dodging a fire blast from Mako, he threw the brothers back with airbending and implored them to listen to him. He calmly explained he was releasing them so they could relay a message from him to Korra.[11]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Threatening the Air Nation\n" +
            "Red Lotus cornering the airbenders\n" +
            "The trio threatened the new airbenders.\n" +
            "Zaheer and his associates arrived to the Northern Air Temple on a Ba Sing Se airship. He jumped down onto a walkway and intercepted Tenzin and his family as the rest of the Red Lotus gathered the temple's occupants into a courtyard. There, Zaheer expressed his pleasure to meet a \"true airbending master\" and told the group he wanted nothing, saying if they cooperated, everyone would escape unharmed. Asked by Tenzin why he came, the airbender stated he wanted Korra and had enough of the chase for her, telling Tenzin he would be using the airbenders for leverage. He also told him he had no choice, but, along with Ghazan and Ming-Hua, was promptly attacked by the master.\n" +
            "Zaheer recovered and dueled with Tenzin. The criminal was forced to rapidly scale the temple's walls as he was continuously attacked. Zaheer tried to counter, but his foe merely broke up his attacks, continuing to force him on the defensive as they climbed to a walkway ledge. At one point, Zaheer was knocked down but recovered, and jumped over Tenzin, nearly attacking him from behind. Tenzin again blocked the attack and soon knocked Zaheer down a second time. Just as the Red Lotus leader was about to be finished off, however, his associates swarmed in, with P'Li knocking Tenzin down from the ledge with a combustion beam and back into the courtyard. With the help of his friends, Zaheer gained the upper hand, though was briefly knocked down again by an air blast. After P'Li blasted Tenzin into a wall, Zaheer, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua surrounded him; the criminal airbender told his foe to give up. With the master refusing to yield, Zaheer dodged a quick air blast and countered. After this did not work, the three Red Lotus members began a relentless barrage on Tenzin.[12]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Capturing Korra\n" +
            "In the Northern Air Temple's radio room, Zaheer was informed by Korra that she would agree to his terms. Wanting to sustain leverage, he told her to meet her at Laghima's Peak at noon on her own; once she was in his captivity, he would release the airbenders. Afterward, he made his way to a small room with a statue of Laghima in it, reciting the guru's writing about letting go a tether and entering the void. He was approached by P'Li, who told him the airbenders were secured. Zaheer thanked his girlfriend and told her he thought about her every day in prison. Afterward, she thanked him for freeing her and showing her true freedom. The airbender assured her the whole world would soon know as such and the two expressed their love, sharing a kiss.\n" +
            "Zaheer captured Korra\n" +
            "Zaheer took Korra into his custody as part of their deal.\n" +
            "Zaheer and P'Li went to the top of Laghima's Peak; upon Korra's arrival, the airbender demanded she drop her airbender staff and surrender, threatening to come after her if she refused. He was told to tell Ghazan to let the airbenders go first, but he told her it was not a negotiation and she would have to do what he said. With the Avatar still hesitant, Zaheer radioed Ghazan to wipe the airbenders out, but promptly told him to stand down when Korra decided to surrender. He told his associate they had Korra secure before he and P'Li led her to their airship. Before they got there, Korra found out the Red Lotus had double-crossed Team Avatar and Zaheer was attacked with air, fire, and earth. He dodged the attacks and threw her down with two blades of air, taking her to the airship while P'Li dealt with the approaching Lin, Suyin, and Metal Clan guards. Just as he began walking up the ramp, however, Tonraq arrived and attacked with water tendrils. While dodging, Zaheer threw the Avatar aside, briefly sending her off the cliff, but she was saved by Tonraq, forcing the criminal to have to deal with both benders.\n" +
            "Zaheer distraught\n" +
            "Zaheer was horrified and grieved by P'Li's death.\n" +
            "Zaheer warded off Korra and Tonraq's strikes with both his bending and agility, barely escaping defeat when he was knocked down by a small line of earth by Korra but dodging out of the way of a blade of ice used by Tonraq. He spun up a tornado and threw the Avatar's father off a cliff. Soon after, however, P'Li was killed by Suyin, stunning the airbender and leaving him vulnerable to attack. He jumped around Korra's blasts, however, and knocked her out with a blade of air. With nowhere to go, however, and surrounded by the metalbenders, he again recited Laghima's poem about letting go of one's earthly tether and slipped from the cliff's edge. Having lost his last earthly attachment, P'Li, he was able to enter the void and achieve weightlessness, taking flight and escaping his foes.\n" +
            "Zaheer levitating\n" +
            "Losing P'Li allowed Zaheer to unlock the power of flight.\n" +
            "Zaheer took Korra to a Red Lotus prison and returned to his allies, telling them how he had achieved flight: letting go of his tethers and entering the void. He also told an inquiring Ming-Hua that P'Li had given herself up for their cause and her sacrifice would not be in vain. Checking up on Korra, he told the enraged Avatar that he understood her grief over losing her father, since he had lost a loved one himself, before telling a Red Lotus guard to bring out a poisonous substance.[3] The airbender told her the poison would trigger the Avatar State before he and his associates would kill her, ending the Avatar Cycle, saying it would bring on a world where man was allied only with himself and loved ones and in natural order without borders nor an Avatar.[5]\n" +
            "Final battle\n" +
            "After telling a guard to administer the poison, Zaheer told his associates to prepare to take her out upon her entering the Avatar State, telling Ghazan she could not resist for long. He soon realized the poison was working as her resistance weakened, watching as the state fully activated. At that moment, Zaheer told his allies to attack, but Korra used her enhanced strength to get out of her bonds and counter. After dodging powerful blasts of earth and fire, Zaheer flew away, but was aggressively pursued by the Avatar.\n" +
            "Zaheer fighting Korra\n" +
            "Using his flight ability, Zaheer engaged Korra in an aerial battle.\n" +
            "Upon being charged, Zaheer threw Korra to a stone pillar, but she managed to slide down it and continue attacking. Flying around the mountain, the agile criminal dodged several rocks and fire blasts before countering with three air whips, knocking his foe to the ground once again. He promptly flew at her and threw her further down a cliffside. However, Korra recovered and the airbender was soon targeted with a large boulder, which he quickly dodged. His ankle was promptly frozen in place by a water whip, causing him to descend rapidly. However, when she proved too physically weakened to land the decisive blow and landed on a cliffside, he used an air punch to shatter the ice and fly to Korra, telling her she could not fight him and the poison. Zaheer soon knocked her further down the cliff with two close-range air blasts and onto a stone pillar.\n" +
            "Bolin silenced Zaheer\n" +
            "After a heated battle, Zaheer was captured.\n" +
            "Declaring the poison did its work, the criminal surrounded her in air and began to suffocate her in a ball of air. At that moment, however, the freed airbenders raised a tornado to their location. He released Korra and grabbed her, attempting to fly away. The tornado ensnared them and he was unable to maintain his grip on her. Zaheer tried to escape, but was grabbed by one of Korra's chains and thrown to the ground. He was detained by Lin and Suyin in an earthen prison, but seeing Korra unable to awaken, laughed and declared the Red Lotus had won. His joy turned to shock, however, when Suyin used her metalbending to remove the metallic poison from within the Avatar. The airbender protested that the Avatar's allies were halting the beginning of the revolution and chaos as the natural order, but was silenced when Bolin stuck a sock in his mouth.[5] He was subsequently imprisoned in an underground chamber located in the mountain range outside Republic City, where he was chained in place to limit his movement. With no freedom in the physical world, Zaheer frequently meditated into the Spirit World.[6]\n" +
            "174 AG\n" +
            "Korra and a chained Zaheer\n" +
            "Zaheer was visited in his prison by Korra, who hoped that by facing him, she would be able to release her fear of him.\n" +
            "After three years, Zaheer was visited by Korra in his underground prison cell and concluded that she must really be in trouble if she came to see him. When she explained that she had merely come to declare that he had no power over her and that she would no longer be afraid of him, Zaheer flew directly toward her. As she cowered back, although his chains prevented him from reaching her, he started to laugh and noted that she still looked scared to him. He halted her from leaving, however, by revealing that he knew she was there because she had been unable to go into the Spirit World. He explained that he spent most of his time in the spiritual realm, where it was well-known that the Avatar's spirit had not been there in years. When Korra incredulously asked if he really could meditate into the Spirit World from his dungeon, since it did not feel spiritually charged, Zaheer declared that to be her problem: the inability to tap into the spiritual energy around her. He remained unfazed as Korra unloaded on him, blaming him for having ruined her, and simply noted that she was using him as a crutch to make herself feel better. When Korra sadly stated that perhaps it was time she accepted that she would never be the same, Zaheer pointed out that neither of them were the same as before their encounter; he had learned how to fly, though was bound by his chains, and while Korra had all the power in the world and the freedom to use it, she chose to hold herself down. He explained that he believed her powers to be limitless, since she had been able to fight off the mercury poison that should have killed her.\n" +
            "Zaheer helping Korra\n" +
            "Despite their history, Zaheer found a common goal with Korra and guided her into the Spirit World by helping her to let go of her fear of him and of \"what might have been\".\n" +
            "Zaheer grew self-conscious about his actions, however, when Korra sarcastically thanked him for assassinating Hou-Ting, which allowed Kuvira, \"the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom [had] ever seen\", to rise to power. Declaring Kuvira needed to be stopped, he offered to help Korra get over her mental block by guiding her into the Spirit World. When she refused, noting he was not to be trusted, Zaheer pointed out that while that may be so, she would not have been there if she had any other options and, although they had been enemies before, their interest aligned for the time being. Zaheer rose into the air and assumed a lotus position, urging Korra to focus on the sound of his voice and clear her mind. As she was haunted by another vision of him trying to asphyxiate her, Zaheer told her to let the vision run its course and accept what had happened to her, as opposed to holding on to a fear of what might have been. When Korra plummeted down in the vision toward the heart of the vortex, he comfortingly noted that she did not need to be afraid and needed to hold on. They both managed to cross over to the Spirit World and, upon being asked if he knew where Jinora, Ryu, and the souls of the other tourists were kept, Zaheer simply replied that Korra already possessed that knowledge before letting his spirit fade back into the physical world.[6]\n" +
            "Legacy\n" +
            "Although imprisoned, Zaheer remained on Korra's mind, as for three years after his encounter with her, the Avatar kept seeing visions of the Red Lotus leader trying to kill her, which prevented her from entering the Spirit World.[6][13][14] In a swamp-induced vision, Zaheer appeared to Korra again in the situation where he was looking as she was struggling to stay out of the Avatar State. When she gasped in horror, Zaheer's apparition reacted and turned around to look at her. Later, he appeared to her again while she was bending the residual traces of mercury out of her body. As she gasped again upon seeing Zaheer, she was urged by Toph Beifong to let go of her fear of him as her battle with the airbender had ended.[15]\n" +
            "Villain conference call\n" +
            "Zaheer was portrayed by Varrick in his mover as the leader of the group consisting of himself, Amon, Unalaq, and Vaatu.\n" +
            "Zaheer's character was also featured in Varrick's story of Bolin, Hero of the World, in which he was described as a \"flying, chaotic, chaos machine\". He teamed up with Amon, Vaatu, and begrudgingly with Unalaq to take out their common nemesis, Bolin, for which he arranged a conference call. Upon ringing Vaatu, he joked that he was glad to have caught him at home, jabbing at the spirit's imprisonment in the Tree of Time. After Unalaq entered the conversation as well, Zaheer and his two other companions tried to get rid of the Chief of the North and eventually just hung up on him. Zaheer was said to be defeated when Bolin pushed him into a tornado, turning him into wind forever.[16]\n" +

            "While self-righteous and merciless in battle, Zaheer has shown himself a patient and composed man.\n" +
            "Zaheer is a staunch anarchist who sees chaos as the only acceptable world order. He is willing to destroy anyone who stands against him and resorts to extreme measures in his campaign to eliminate the governments of the world. However, he is not indiscriminately violent, as he shows no desire to needlessly attack others who pose no threat to him or his ideals, which was demonstrated when he told Ming-Hua to release an innocent radio operator in Ba Sing Se.[11] At the same time, he genuinely cares for the people he trusts, such as P'Li, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua, whom he treats as equals even though he is their leader. Zaheer's affection for P'Li was of such magnitude that she was his last earthly tether and it was only after her death that he was able to fly. However, his more caring nature does not prevent him from doing away with those whom he deems a liability for his goals, as exemplified when he condemned Aiwei's spirit to roam the Fog of Lost Souls for eternity.[1]\n" +
            "Zaheer loses his temper\n" +
            "Despite usually maintaining a calm and collected demeanor, Zaheer has the potential to become frantic and irrational in defeat.\n" +
            "He is clever and innovative, able to plan quickly and efficiently, as well as charming and charismatic when he needed to be, enabling him to sweet talk his way into homes[8] or strike deals with people.[11] He is intelligent and patient, though he is also capable of ruthless violence, as demonstrated by his murder of Hou-Ting[11] and attempted murders of Tonraq and Korra. Although generally composed, he can lose his temper in complete defeat, as evidenced when he started to rant upon witnessing Korra's survival.[5]\n" +
            "Though he does not care for the idea of nations, Zaheer has an affinity for the Air Nomads' philosophy and mindset, save for their pacifistic nature. When he became an airbender, he took it as a sign that the path of the Red Lotus was a righteous one and used his knowledge of Air Nomad culture to quickly develop his new skills.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Blaming governments and world leaders to be the cause of the greatest imbalances in the world, Zaheer holds the belief that disorder is the only true order,[1] a philosophy that promotes chaos and pandemonium as the true attributes of freedom and individuality.[11]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Despite being defeated by the Avatar and imprisoned, Zaheer maintained a strong belief in his goals and still worked to achieve them. As such, he showed no resentment toward Korra for defeating him and even agreed to help her when he learned that his assassination of Hou-Ting allowed Kuvira to place the Earth Kingdom under her military dictatorship.[6]\n" +

            "Despite only having airbending abilities for a short time and being self-taught, Zaheer displays high proficiency in the art. He is capable of creating large air currents capable of knocking people off balance,[2] as well as increase his agility to evade attacks, enabling him to take on multiple benders at a time.[4] Although he is not as powerful as a full-fledged master like Tenzin, he was proficient enough in combat to more or less hold his own against the more experienced airbender, though he needed the assistance of his companions to defeat the master.[12] He is also capable of using a glider, both in combat and as a means of transportation despite having no training in using one. He can take on multiple opponents at once[8] and, since he is not a pacifist like most airbenders, he also uses his airbending in a more offensive and even lethal manner, such as pulling the air out of Hou-Ting's lungs and suffocating her.[11]\n" +
            "Flight\n" +
            "Zaheer flying\n" +
            "Becoming devoid of all earthly tethers after P'Li's death, Zaheer became the second airbender in history to unlock the ability of flight.\n" +
            "During a battle to rescue Korra from the Red Lotus, Zaheer developed the ability of flight through the teachings of Guru Laghima, becoming the first airbender in four thousand years to do so. As a result of P'Li's death at the hands of Suyin, Zaheer let go of his final earthly tether and jumped off the mountain, with Korra over his shoulder, flying off toward the stolen airship acquired by Ming-Hua and Ghazan. Zaheer has demonstrated that the power of flight allows for fast and agile movements, being able to out-speed an injured Korra while she was in the Avatar State and performing airbending attacks whilst airborne.[5]\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Prior to obtaining airbending, Zaheer was a master in several forms of martial arts and had extensive combat experience.[17] He was deemed dangerous enough to be detained in an isolated prison similar to his bending cohorts and had to turn his back to the cell doors with his hands behind his head while receiving food. Zaheer is remarkably agile and acrobatic.[2]\n" +
            "Zaheer is also well-versed in Air Nomad philosophy and history, mainly teachings of the legendary airbender, Guru Laghima, whom he holds in high regard.[2] Through meditation, Zaheer can enter the Spirit World and freely teleport himself and others to various places in that realm.[1] Due to having practiced, trained, and meditated for years, he can still communicate with his body in the physical world while his soul is in the Spirit World.[18]\n" +

However, when the complete conquest of Republic City by the Equalists became imminent, Amon's true identity was exposed to the public by Avatar Korra. In actuality, he was a prodigious Northern Water Tribe bloodbender, son of the escaped crime boss, Yakone. Alongside his younger brother, the former councilman, Tarrlok, Amon was unknowingly shaped by Yakone to be a tool for his revenge against the Avatar.[4]\n" +

            "When Noatak and Tarrlok both discovered they were waterbenders, Yakone trained them ruthlessly to develop their skills. When Noatak was ten, Yakone took his sons on a supposed hunting trip far from their home, where he revealed his true identity as a Republic City criminal and explained to them the power of bloodbending. Claiming that their family had the strongest line of bloodbenders in history and with the intent of making his sons bloodbenders of the highest caliber, Yakone trained them secretly during every full moon to use their bloodbending on animals, such as yaks and wolves. Reveling in his newfound power, Noatak also mastered Yakone's unique psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen. As a bloodbending prodigy, he carried the burden of all Yakone's expectations and over the years, he became cold and detached.[5]\n" +

When Tarrlok refused to bloodbend Noatak, Yakone became angry, calling him weak, and prepared to attack him as punishment. However, Noatak defended his brother by bloodbending his own father, stating that Yakone, having been stripped of his waterbending by the Avatar, was actually the weak one. Noatak subsequently offered his brother to join him to start a new life away from Yakone, but Tarrlok declined, arguing that he was worried about their mother, thus causing Noatak to agree with his father's opinion of Tarrlok being weak. He ran off into the blizzard, prompting Yakone and Tarrlok to search for him in the following days; they eventually assumed that he had perished in the storm.[5]\n" +

He assumed the alias of \"Amon\" and became the leader of the Equalists, an organization striving to rid the world of bending. To garner sympathy and hide that he was a bender himself, Amon claimed that he was born on a small farm to a poor family of nonbenders who were being extorted by a firebender. When his father supposedly confronted the bender, he and the rest of his family were murdered and Amon's face was left scarred, forcing him to hide behind a mask ever since. He also claimed that he had been granted the power to remove bending by the spirits because they believed the Avatar had failed the world and wanted him to usher in an era of equality.[1][5]\n" +

            "After Avatar Korra announced her official relocation to Republic City during a press conference at City Hall, Amon told his second-in-command that the Avatar's arrival would force them to accelerate their plans.[6]\n" +
            "Later, at an Equalist assembly called \"The Revelation\", Amon revealed his plan to eradicate the world of benders, as they \"had only brought suffering\" and \"were the cause of every war in every era\". Amon rallied the sympathy of his followers with a false backstory, in which his family, all nonbenders, was extorted by a firebender and his face was left horribly scarred. He also claimed to have been chosen by the spirits to usher in a new era of balance to the world by permanently removing people's bending in order to make equality a reality.\n" +

            "Zolt being bloodbent\n" +
            "Amon removed Lightning Bolt Zolt's firebending.\n" +
            "As a demonstration of his abilities, Amon had his Equalist henchmen bring forward several captured Triple Threat Triad members, along with Bolin, and proceeded to remove their bending one by one, starting with the firebending of the notorious crime boss Lightning Bolt Zolt, whom he was able to defeat without the use of any offensive attacks. However, before he could finally purge Bolin of his earthbending, Korra orchestrated a distraction by releasing a screen of water vapor into the room, allowing Mako to rescue Bolin in the resulting confusion and escape. As the brothers and Korra were riding away on Naga, tailed by several Equalists, Amon allowed them to escape, remarking that the Avatar would be the perfect individual to spread word about his powerful new ability.[1]\n" +
            "Meeting Avatar Korra\n" +
            "Before officially meeting Korra, Amon had made a severe impression on her with his actions during the Revelation rally by unknowingly plaguing her with nightmares in which he removed her bending. After being proclaimed public enemy number one by the United Republic Council, he spread a message over the radio to his fellow Equalists, using the actions of the Council as proof of benders' oppressive nature.\n" +
            "Amon threatening Korra\n" +
            "Amon threatened to destroy Korra once and for all during their final showdown.\n" +
            "After Councilman Tarrlok and Avatar Korra led a task force that successfully raided an Equalist training facility, Amon was publicly challenged by the Avatar to a midnight duel on Aang Memorial Island without the involvement of the task force or chi blockers. However, Amon did not arrive on time, nor did he come alone. Just as Korra began to leave the island, several hidden Equalists reeled her inside the island's museum, where she was quickly overpowered and incapacitated by chi blocking. Amon emerged from the shadows and revealed that he would allow her to keep her bending for the time being, stating that she would otherwise become a martyr and cause benders from every nation to rally behind her \"untimely demise\". However, he warned a terrified Korra that he would \"save her for last\" and finally \"destroy her\" in their inevitable showdown. With that final statement, he proceeded to knock her out and flee with his group.[7]\n" +

            "Amon forcibly removed the bending of Tahno and the other Wolfbats.\n" +
            "On the eve of the Pro-bending Championship match, Amon demanded that the Council end the hero-worship of bending athletes by shutting down the Pro-bending Arena and canceling the tournament, threatening \"severe consequences\" should they refuse. The Council voted to keep the arena open, which Amon revealed to be in line with his plans for the situation. At the conclusion of the championship match, he entered the arena and stripped the victors, Tahno and the rest of the White Falls Wolfbats, of their bending powers.\n" +
            "While his Equalists overpowered members of the Metalbending Police Force in the stands with electrified gloves, the revolutionary leader gave a speech in which he condemned benders, using the cheating of the Wolfbats as an example of their typical abusive behavior toward their fellow nonbending citizens. Furthermore, he stated that the fate of the same pro-bending team served as a warning to all benders who dared to oppose his goals.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Later in his monologue, Amon mentioned that the current tyrannical bending regime would soon be replaced with \"a fair minded, Equalist\" government. To this end, he planned on disposing of the bending arts in Republic City, his idealized start to eventually equalize the entire world. Declaring the revolution to have begun, he devastated the central playing field with a timed explosion before leaving the arena through the roof on an airship. Boarding the zeppelin, he narrowly escaped Korra's firebending attack and disappeared altogether.[8]\n" +

            "Days later, Amon, accompanied by the Lieutenant and a group of Equalists, found Tarrlok in his hideout deep in the mountains surrounding Republic City. Upon being warned that it was his time to be \"equalized\", the Councilman defended himself by bloodbending his attackers. Although his henchmen were easily subdued by Tarrlok, Amon's skill in the practice allowed him to resist, much to the Councilman's shock. When asked what he was, referring to his ability to overcome the effects of bloodbending, Amon simply responded that he was \"the solution\" and proceeded to take Tarrlok's bending. He chose to handle the defeated Tarrlok on his own, as he was worried that people would find out that they were brothers.[9]\n" +
            "While taking care of Tarrlok, he ordered his fellow Equalists to retrieve Korra, who was trapped inside a metal box in the basement. He warned his men not to underestimate her and ordered them to electrify the box, which would leave her knocked out when they opened it. However, as he was putting Tarrlok in the truck in which they had arrived, Korra stormed out of the cabin, having overpowered the other Equalists. Noticing Amon, she shot several ice spears in his direction; the Equalist leader evaded them all and briefly gave chase, but stopped when Korra made her escape by swiftly gliding down the snowy slopes of the mountain. When the Lieutenant and the other Equalists joined him in watching the Avatar leave, he scolded them for having underestimated her.[10]\n" +

            "Amon observed the start of the battle for Republic City from an airship floating above the metropolis. Eventually, his airship was in the vicinity of the police headquarters as Tenzin and Team Avatar were fighting the Equalists' mecha tanks. After Hiroshi Sato, who was present aboard the airship with Amon, expressed his disgust while watching his daughter fighting alongside benders, the revolutionary leader promised him that he would have his daughter back soon.\n" +
            "That evening, after the entire city had fallen, Amon arrived on Air Temple Island, where his followers brought a captured Lin Beifong to him. He offered her the chance to keep her bending in exchange for information regarding Korra's whereabouts, but at her defiant refusal, Amon proceeded to take away her bending.[11]\n" +
            "Endgame\n" +
            "After the original inhabitants had fled, Amon re-purposed Air Temple Island into his base of operations and had his followers bring forth all captured benders in order to strip them of their powers. He had taken residence in the tower on the island and used it as a makeshift prison for the captured Tarrlok. Having witnessed Amon leaving the island in an airship to head down toward the Pro-bending Arena for the Equalist victory rally, Mako and Korra entered the tower, where Tarrlok revealed Amon's backstory and true identity as Noatak.[5]\n" +

            "Amon and his followers tried to thwart the rescue of the airbenders.\n" +
            "With the city under his control, Amon started his victory speech at the arena by retelling his fabricated story from the Revelation rally. However, he was interrupted by Korra, who called him by his true name and outed him as a waterbender who used the illegal skill of bloodbending to take people's bending away as opposed to using a gift given to him by the spirits. Though his family tree was revealed by the Avatar, Amon remained calm and confident and refuted Korra's accusations by taking off his mask, revealing the supposed scar on his face that was bestowed upon him by a firebender. Using convincing makeup to fool the audience, Amon managed to turn the tables and make Korra out to be the liar in the eyes of his supporters. When the Avatar and Mako were about to leave, Amon urged them to stay, directing their attention to Tenzin and his children whom he had captured. Aiming to \"rid the world of airbending\", he invited them to come down to the stage to try and stop him. Arrogantly turning his back to the duo to face Tenzin, he was forced to jump out of the path of Mako's lightning attack. Although he was able to easily avoid Mako's fire blasts, the air swipes that the freed Tenzin threw at him proved to be too much, and he was flung off the stage.\n" +
            "Amon taking Korra&#039;s bending\n" +
            "Amon removed Korra's bending.\n" +
            "Amon recovered quickly and went after Korra and Mako, who were acting as a diversion to let Tenzin and his family escape. He found them in one of the arena's storage rooms and subdued them easily with his bloodbending, believing that they were alone with no witnesses. However, after taking away Korra's bending, Amon realized his distraught lieutenant had witnessed the whole thing. Being denounced as a traitor by his second-in-command, Amon was forced to defend himself, using his bloodbending to easily stop the attack and send his lieutenant flying into a pile of wooden boards. The distraction provided Mako with the time that he needed to charge a lightning attack, enabling him to immobilize Amon so he could grab a severely weakened Korra to escape. However, Amon caught up with them quickly and again used his bloodbending to effectively halt them.\n" +
            "He prepared to take away Mako's bending, musing over the fact that no one else had been able to get the better of him, and that it was almost a shame to take bending away from one so talented. With his attention drawn away from the downed and seemingly powerless Korra, Amon was completely caught off-guard when she, seeing Mako in danger, suddenly unlocked her airbending and used it to knock him away from the firebender. As she unleashed a barrage of air attacks upon him, flinging him through the hallway, he briefly regained the upper hand with bloodbending. Korra, however, managed to break his hold on her, blasting him out of a window into the harbor below with an air kick, where he began sinking rapidly into the sea after losing consciousness.\n" +

            "Amon's identity as a waterbender was exposed.\n" +
            "Unaware that the water had washed his fake scar away, he regained consciousness underwater and instinctively used his waterbending to emerge from the sea on a giant waterspout to avoid drowning, exposing his waterbending abilities to his followers that were outside. Realizing he had lost all of his leverage and followers, he made his escape, dropping back into the water to avoid Mako's barrage of fire blasts. He managed to make his way back to Air Temple Island, where he released Tarrlok, expressing regret for what he had done to him and once more offering his younger brother a chance to leave with him so they could start a new life together, as he was all he had left in the world.\n" +
            "The two brothers acquired a speedboat and made their way out of Republic City, journeying across the Mo Ce Sea. Amon expressed his joy of being together with family again, though admitted he had almost forgotten the sound of the name he was born with and knew when he still had a loving family. As he drove the boat, the defeated revolutionary shed a tear upon hearing his brother assure him it would be like the old days, right before Tarrlok used one of the many electrified gloves kept in the boat to ignite its fuel tank, wanting to bring an end to what he referred to as their sad story. The resulting explosion formed a large mushroom cloud, visible from afar, killing them both.[4]\n" +

            "Legacy\n" +
            "When Korra was administered a poison by the Red Lotus that would force her to enter the Avatar State, Amon appeared to her in a hallucination, telling her that the world did not need her anymore. Emphasizing the futility of her resistance, he urged her, together with hallucinations of Unalaq and Vaatu, to let go and enter the Avatar State.[12] He appeared to Korra again in a swamp-induced vision, in which she witnessed the Equalist leader removing her bending.[13]\n" +
            "Villain conference call\n" +
            "Amon was portrayed by Varrick in his mover as part of the villain group consisting of himself, Zaheer, Unalaq, and Vaatu.\n" +
            "Amon was later used by Varrick in his story of Bolin, Hero of the World, in which he was described as a zombie. He was added to the conference call Zaheer was having with Vaatu and although he expressed his willingness to help take out their common nemesis, Bolin, deeming him to be \"way too powerful and awesome\", he wanted to leave Unalaq out of the team, though soon found out the Chief of the North had been listening in on their conversation. Amon and his two other companions tried to get rid of Unalaq and eventually just hung up on him. Amon's plot line was ignored in the rest of the mover script.[14]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "Anti-bending Revolution\n" +
            "Amon displayed great charisma as an orator.\n" +
            "Noatak was once a caring boy who strove to protect his younger brother. However, having been corrupted by the use of bloodbending at a young age and having to endure the burden of all of Yakone's expectations due to his prowess, Amon became a calm and composed individual, more cold and detached from the world. He developed some sociopathic aspects and a desire for power, fueled by his intent for equality among everyone. Amon had somewhat idolized Avatar Aang's ability to remove an individual's bending, believing that skill to be more powerful than bloodbending. In time, Amon had eventually devised his own technique to remove one's bending by utilizing his bloodbending to sever the bender's connection with their bending ability.[5]\n" +
            "Amon had a severe abhorrence toward benders and was a staunch believer in what he viewed as equality, affectionately referring to his followers as \"brothers and sisters\".[1] Amon sincerely believed in his rhetoric, having striven to be fair and treat everyone equally since he was a child. Ultimately, it was a misguided desire for justice as well as latent lust for power that led him to start the Anti-bending Revolution.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "He was clever and composed, as well as a convincing orator. He had a high command of the art of public speaking, knowing how to mystify and terrify his audiences and enemies alike, inspiring loyalty with each word and gaining widespread following for his cause. At the beginning of the revolution, he seemed to have plans for Korra and avoided fighting her, resorting to allowing her to escape and spread word of his abilities to the city.[1] Amon also chose not to take away her bending when he ambushed her after refusing to fight her, foreseeing that it would make her a martyr for benders and unite them globally against his cause.[7] His proactive and logical thinking typically put him \"one step ahead\".\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Amon&#039;s scar\n" +
            "Amon's fake scar was the fabricated proof of his fictional cover story.\n" +
            "Amon was a calculating and manipulative individual; his schemes were well planned and executed with great efficiency. He was also cautious, as he avoided direct conflict with benders, especially those with great power such as Korra, knowing that he risked exposure in facing them. He displayed utter fearlessness, which was exhibited when he was nearly blasted by Korra's firebending, overcoming Tarrlok's bloodbending, and chasing after Korra following her escape from Tarrlok's hideout. To support his pseudo backstory of a firebender scarring his face, Amon used makeup to make it appear that he had actually been scarred.[4]\n" +
            "He was a strong-willed individual in possession of a high level of self-control, making him an extremely formidable opponent. His calm composure never wavered; when Korra escaped her prison and fired large missiles of ice at him, Amon did not hesitate to chase after her, but he remained composed when he lightly scolded his subordinates for underestimating her, which he had warned against.[10] Mortal danger and his strong instinct to survive caused him to slip up once, revealing his true self. However, even in a distraught state, he regained his composure rather quickly, successfully enabling him to escape.\n" +

            "Abilities\n" +
            "Waterbending\n" +
            "Drilled relentlessly by his father in waterbending, Amon displayed a natural talent for waterbending, quickly impressing Yakone and ultimately mastering the art under his father's tutelage. A true prodigy, his mastery of the art was immense; he was capable of launching himself out of a body of water on a gigantic waterspout and propelling himself over the surface at a speed exceeding that of Mako's fire blasts.[4]\n" +
            "Bloodbending\n" +
            "Amon bloodbending Korra and Mako\n" +
            "Amon effortlessly subdued two skilled benders, Korra and Mako, using bloodbending.\n" +
            "Amon just as quickly mastered the rare and outlawed art of bloodbending, becoming exceptionally skilled and powerful at the ability. Under Yakone's tutelage, he mastered the technique to such an extent that he could perform it at anytime, without the aid of a full moon, by the age of fourteen. At the same time, he also learned his father's special skill of psychic bending, allowing him to perform his bending skills not only through physical movement, but also through sheer focus and strength of will. As the son of the infamous bloodbending criminal Yakone, Amon was also able to use more common bloodbending techniques, such as body manipulation and torture, to an extremely powerful degree while exerting minimal effort. He could also levitate his targets, throw them around, subdue them, and knock them unconscious. With his skill in psychic bending, he could also bloodbend one or multiple targets into submission while able to freely move in for other measures to finish his opponent. Additionally, he exhibited the ability to resist bloodbending with little effort, even against his brother, Tarrlok, who had also mastered the skill to a similar level.[10]\n" +
            "Amon taking Lin&#039;s bending away\n" +
            "Amon used bloodbending to strip Lin Beifong of her bending abilities.\n" +
            "Despite growing fascinated by this skill, he ultimately desired more, wanting to have the power to remove people's bending, just as Avatar Aang had done to his father with the use of energybending. He eventually succeeded in this goal by using his mastery of bloodbending to \"sever\" an individual's bending connection by blocking their active chi paths, effectively achieving the same result as energybending.[15] No medical intervention was effective in reversing this effect, and even Katara, a world-renowned healer and bloodbending expert in her own right, was unable to reverse its effects. The only known way to reverse Amon's bending-block is through the use of energybending, as demonstrated by Avatars Aang and Korra.[4]\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Amon fighting Tarrlok\n" +
            "Amon's agility and unarmed combat skills made him a match for even the strongest of benders, like Tarrlok.\n" +
            "Amon epitomized versatility in many ways. He concealed his bending abilities through masterful hand-to-hand combat skills and the art of chi blocking. His prowess proved great enough to defeat even the most powerful of benders. He also demonstrated his agility as a nimble fighter, allowing him to maneuver gracefully and evade bending assaults with ease, even at close-range.[1] He also supplemented his hand-to-hand skills with minor applications of his bloodbending in order to better defend and redirect enemy assaults. Apart from his combat skills, Amon had extreme physical resilience that allowed him to recover from a point-blank lightning bolt shot by Mako in mere seconds and subdue him with bloodbending.\n" +
            "Aside from his combat abilities, Amon also possessed great intellect and charisma, making him a master manipulator. He effectively masqueraded his bloodbending technique, which he used to sever people's bending, as a mystical weapon given to him by the spirits. He was able to maintain this facade consistently even under the heat of battle. A gifted political strategist, he accurately portended that if he removed the Avatar's bending too early in his revolution, it would only end in Korra becoming a martyr, ensuring that benders across the globe would unite against his anti-bending agenda.[4] He took his charade to such heights that apart from wearing a mask, he even applied make-up to fake a large facial scar to legitimize his fabricated story of being mutilated by a firebender in order to further drive bending hate and sympathy for his cause.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As evidenced by the multiple attacks orchestrated by the Equalists, Amon was also a capable strategist and tactician, outmatching other organized forces such as the Metalbending Police Force and the United Forces armada on several occasions. He was also well-versed in terrorist tactics, subverting nonbenders by manipulating their hate and bestowing fear upon benders, always seeking a psychological edge against his opponents, and consistently using intimidation and threats against his numerous enemies.\n";

            "In 171 AG, P'Li was visited in her prison cell by Lord Zuko, Southern Chief Tonraq, and Northern chiefs Desna and Eska following the escapes of Zaheer, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua from their respective prisons. Having not been visited by anyone \"interesting\" in thirteen years, P'Li deduced that the visit must have been because of Zaheer's escape, much to her pleasure.[6]\n" +

            "Shortly afterward, P'Li's associates arrived at the North Pole to free her. Ming-Hua soon came and weakened the cell door with ice, causing it to fall open. The firebender's chains were broken off by Ming-Hua's water tentacles, and the two exited by climbing up the ice wall. P'Li called her friend a showoff for using her water arms to climb out the prison, believing they could have taken the elevator instead.\n" +

            "The two found themselves confronted by Zuko's dragon, Druk, who blasted fire at them, but P'Li redirected the flames around her and absorbed the heat of the attack. After \"waiting thirteen years to feel this warm\", she subsequently used a combustion beam attack to blast Druk away. The firebender used this technique a second time after noticing Tonraq fighting her boyfriend, destroying the chief's ice wall and knocking him out. The four soon fled the scene in a truck. While in the vehicle, P'Li embraced Zaheer and confessed her worries about never seeing him again before they shared a passionate kiss, much to Ghazan's annoyance.[4]\n" +

            "The group traveled to Republic City, where Zaheer infiltrated Air Temple Island under a pseudonym, \"Yorru\", in an attempt to find the Avatar once again. However, Zaheer's cover was blown and, after he escaped, the group found themselves being pursued by the Metalbending Police Force. Deciding to flee, the gang commandeered a truck and coerced its driver into smuggling them out of the city. Upon the driver being stopped at a security checkpoint and being caught lying about his plans, he ran off, forcing the criminals to take control of the vehicle and make their escape. As police cars pursued them, P'Li used a combustion attack to down a few cars before Ghazan turned a part of the road into lava to stop the pursuit.\n" +
            "As soon as they were far away from the city, Ming-Hua complained that they should have grabbed a police officer to force the Avatar's whereabouts out of him. P'Li assured her that they would find Korra again. At that moment, Zaheer came out of meditation and announced that the Avatar was with the Metal Clan in Zaofu.[7]\n" +

            "P'Li and her friends traveled to Zaofu and broke into Korra's room in Suyin's estate, capturing her as Zaheer paralyzed the Avatar and Naga with shirshu-spit darts. However, they were seen by Mako and Bolin. P'Li dissipated a fire blast from the former and retaliated with her own fire. After the Zaofu guards discovered them and aimed search lights on them, P'Li used her precise combustion technique to blow up the lights, before arcing a combustion blast to hit the brothers. The four were soon surrounded by metal panels launched at them by the estate's guards, Lin, Suyin, and the twins Wei and Wing. Ghazan kept the group safe by separating them from their attackers with a pool of lava. P'Li continued to attempt attacking their foes with combustionbending; one of her attacks was blocked just short of connecting with Team Avatar by Suyin, Wei, and Wing. After being pushed into a defensive position, P'Li was taken down by a well-placed shard of earth sent by Bolin; the strike hit her in her third eye, temporarily blocking her chi. This enabled Lin and Suyin to save Korra without being hurt. Upon realizing that they would not be able to reclaim the Avatar, Zaheer bent a sphere of wind, camouflaging the group and giving them time to escape.[8]\n" +
            "Misty Palms Oasis\n" +
            "In a cave in the Si Wong Desert, near the Misty Palms Oasis, a meditating Zaheer informed the group Korra was at the nearby Misty Palms Inn. P'Li told Ming-Hua and Ghazan to track the Avatar down while she would keep watch over her partner's body. She later watched as the two brought back Mako and Bolin; and Zaheer told them they would be pursuing the Avatar to Ba Sing Se.[9]\n" +
            "Throwing Ba Sing Se into anarchy\n" +
            "En route to Ba Sing Se, P'Li sat next to Zaheer in the front of the truck, while Ghazan and Ming-Hua guarded the brothers. Having arrived, the group made their way toward the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace, where P'Li witnessed how Zaheer struck a deal with Earth Queen Hou-Ting: information about the airbenders' whereabouts in exchange for the Avatar. After overhearing that the airship transporting Korra had crashed in the Si Wong Desert, P'Li determined that the Avatar would be long gone by the time the next Earth Kingdom airship could get to her.\n" +

            "Deciding to take matters in their own hands and thus force Korra to come to them, the Red Lotus barged into the throne room. When Hou-Ting ordered her Dai Li agents to apprehend them, P'Li used her combustionbending to keep them at bay. After all the bodyguards were taken care of and Zaheer had suffocated the Queen, P'Li accompanied Ming-Hua and Zaheer to the city's communications room in order for the latter to made a city-wide announcement of the end of the reign of Hou-Ting.[10]\n" +
            "Threatening the Air Nation\n" +
            "P'Li and the Red Lotus made their way to the Northern Air Temple. As her associates gathered the temple's occupants in the courtyard, she remained aboard the airship, using her blasts to attack the airbenders who tried to escape, keeping them at bay and providing cover for her compatriots. Although Kai managed to distract her long enough for the others to reach the flying bison stables with a well-placed blast, P'Li shot the young airbender out of the sky with a direct hit, sending him down the mountain. She subsequently focused on the bison awaiting the arrival of the temple's inhabitants, scaring off the creatures and effectively trapping the denizens. With nowhere to go, she left them at the stables to attack Kya and Bumi, who were hanging over the temple's ledge. Her attack missed, however, as Bumi let himself and his sister fall down at the last second. P'Li moved on to give Zaheer aerial support in his battle against Tenzin, shifting the odds in the favor of the Red Lotus as she blasted Tenzin off the ledge of a walkway and into the attacking range of Ming-Hua and Ghazan, before throwing him against a wall with another blast, enabling her associates to corner him.[11]\n" +

            "With tears in her eyes, P'Li expressed her love for Zaheer, the man who showed her what true freedom meant.\n" +
            "P'Li gathered up the airbenders and flew them toward an ancient cave-complex situated a few miles away from the Northern Air Temple, releasing them in the custody of four uniformed Red Lotus members. Upon making her way back to the temple, she found Zaheer meditating and reported to him that the airbenders had been secured. When Zaheer confessed to her that not one day had gone by during his imprisonment without him thinking of her, she reiterated the feeling, stating that their separation had only strengthened her love for him and that she had always known that he would free her, just like he had done when they first met. With tears in her eyes, she lovingly caressed his face, reminding him that he had shown her what true freedom meant. Affirming their love for each other, P'Li and Zaheer kissed.\n" +
            "P&#039;Li&#039;s death\n" +
            "P'Li's combustion attack was contained by Suyin's armor and exploded around her head, resulting in her death.\n" +
            "P'Li later accompanied Zaheer to the top of Laghima's Peak, where Korra was supposed to turn herself over to the Red Lotus in exchange for the airbenders. She put restraints around the Avatar's wrists and ankles, revealing to Korra that the shackles were made from platinum, making any metalbending attempt useless. P'Li guided Korra toward the airship to return to the temple, but before they could board, Korra blew her backward with airbending, having been alerted that the Red Lotus had not kept their end of the deal. Upon noticing the arrival of Lin and Suyin Beifong, as well as Metal Clan reinforcements, P'Li told Zaheer to take Korra into the airship while she held off the metalbenders. She managed to do as such, pinning them down behind the rocks surrounding the peak. However, when Lin drew her fire, she was caught off guard by Suyin, who bent her own armor around P'Li's head just as she released her combustion attack to shoot down Lin. The contained blast exploded around her head, killing her.[1]\n" +
            "Personality\n" +
            "P'Li was fiercely loyal to Zaheer and his cause to eliminate nations and world leaders in order to instigate an era of chaos and freedom. Deeply in love with Zaheer,[4] she displayed a protective streak when it came to him, as evidenced when she readily stayed behind to guard his body while his soul was still in the Spirit World[9] and to hold back Lin, Suyin, and the other metalbenders to give Zaheer a chance to escape with Korra.[1]\n" +
            "Abilities\n" +
            "Firebending\n" +
            "Despite relying mostly on her combustionbending, P'Li was a skilled combatant and a powerful firebender, having been able to easily disperse a fire blast from a dragon using traditional firebending.[4]\n" +
            "Combustionbending\n" +
            "P&#039;Li fires a combustion beam\n" +
            "P'Li's primary fighting style involved the use of combustionbending.\n" +
            "P'Li was also a combustionbender; able to perform the rare technique which produces a concentrated beam of heat from her forehead which, upon impact, produces a powerful explosion. Her combustion blasts had great destructive power, able to demolish most targets. She was able to use it with relative ease, firing several beams in succession to subdue numerous opponents. She is able to fire these beams over great distances with considerable accuracy. At the same time, she was the only known user of the technique capable of curving her blasts, effectively enabling her to strike from various angles and directions. Despite P'Li's precision, a single strike to her forehead temporarily disrupted her ability to focus her chi and properly fire a combustion beam.[8]\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Although usually stationary while using her combustion to overwhelm her enemies, P'Li was very nimble and evasive, able to twist and flip out of the way of a barrage of boulders.\n";

Two weeks after Harmonic Convergence, she joined her friends in the search for the new airbenders. However, their search stopped when the Red Lotus attempted to kidnap Avatar Korra in Zaofu and they worked to bring the organization down instead.

Although unknown to her, the occurrence also resulted in her father developing a grudge against all benders that would culminate in him joining the Equalists and becoming their weapons' manufacturer.[1]\n" +

Feeling guilty over the accident, she apologized and, after recognizing him as the captain of the Fire Ferrets, she invited him to dinner at Kwong's Cuisine. After hearing of the Fire Ferrets' financial situation and as a big pro-bending fan, Asami convinced her father to sponsor the team through Future Industries. After that, their relationship grew further.[7]\n" +
            "After the Pro-bending Arena was attacked,[10] Asami offered shelter to Mako and Bolin at the Sato estate. Shortly afterward, Korra accused Hiroshi of being an Equalist, causing Lin, Tenzin, and the Metalbending Police Force to search her home, who discovered Korra had been correct. Asami was deeply hurt by her father's allegiance and chose to fight against him and the Equalists.[1]\n" +

            "Six months after Amon's defeat and Hiroshi's imprisonment, Asami had assumed control of Future Industries. However, with the reputation of the company low as a result of her father's association with the Equalists, Asami took a trip to the Southern Water Tribe to meet the entrepreneur Varrick in order to save her company from bankruptcy. With a civil war between the two tribes brewing, Asami joined Korra in attempting to prevent the conflict.\n" +
            "Along with the others, Asami went back to Republic City in order to meet President Raiko. There, she also checked how her company was performing. Noticing that her company needed more money, Varrick suggested she sell the mecha tanks to the Southerners. However, following the theft of Future Industries' shipments, Asami and Mako set up a sting operation with the Triple Threat Triad to capture the thieves. However, the duo was betrayed and the company's entire stock of equipment was stolen. With nowhere else to turn, Asami sold a majority stake of Future Industries to Varrick. She and Mako also started dating again, though was left in doubt of him when he was charged with the theft of her company's products.\n" +

            "Although President Raiko refused to help Korra against Unalaq, Asami readily offered her assistance and traveled down to the South Pole with the rest of Team Avatar on the battleship they acquired from Varrick. Devising a plan to attack from above, she used Varrick's plane to create a diversion with Mako and Bolin, hoping it would provide Korra, Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi with the opportunity to enter the Spirit World. The plan failed, however, and everyone save for Bumi was imprisoned. After Bumi freed them all, Korra instructed Asami to fly a wounded Tonraq back to the healing huts, while the benders would enter the Spirit World in order to stop Unalaq from merging with Vaatu as well as finding Jinora's spirit. Asami remained at the healing hut with Katara, Tonraq, and Senna, watching over Jinora's body. When the young airbender awoke, Asami immediately inquired about the safety of her friends and was relieved to hear that Korra had saved the world.[14]\n" +

            "Asami comforted Korra after a press conference in City Hall, assuaging her displeasure over her approval ratings following Harmonic Convergence.\n" +
            "Following Harmonic Convergence, Asami met with Korra at President Raiko's press conference. Seeing the Avatar lament her poor approval among the citizens, Asami tried to tell her not to take it to heart, believing it to be nothing but frustration. After returning to Air Temple Island, Asami wondered where Mako was, to which Bolin answered that the firebender remained at police headquarters. Soon after, she became witness to Bumi's newfound airbending abilities. She watched the next day as Bumi attempted to airbend again. Lin and Mako soon visited Air Temple Island and gave the group reports of other airbenders in the city. The young industrialist also watched with concern as Mako acted awkwardly around her and Korra.\n" +
            "Asami and Korra went out for a drive, the former offering her friend the keys to a Satomobile, believing she was capable of a relaxing ride. It turned out to be anything but, as she had to give panicked instructions at points. Once they settled, the two talked about everything that had happened while they were each involved with Mako. Soon, they approached a mass of vines, which Asami quickly alerted Korra to, stopping just in time.[15]\n" +

            "After Team Avatar decided to travel the Earth Kingdom in the search for airbenders, Asami furnished them with a Future Industries airship, believing they should travel in style. When Asami and the group arrived at the first village, they met Kuon, the new airbender, and joined his family for dinner, but the conversation quickly fell apart when he refused to leave his home. As they left, Asami believed they could have tried harder to convince him to join them. Further visits to villages failed to yield any success, and the group decided to perform an \"air show\" to help convince other airbenders to join them. When Korra used her airbending to \"capture\" Mako, who was playing a firebending convict, overdid it somewhat, both Asami and Korra chuckled with joy. After the show was complete, they managed to recruit just one airbender, a boy named Kai, who claimed his parents were killed by outlaws. Instead, the young boy was a thief who was being pursued by the town police force. Still, the group accepted him as he said he would make a change.[16]\n" +

            "As the group neared Ba Sing Se, Asami watched as Jinora attempted to train Bumi as he sparred unsuccessfully with Kai. Upon arrival in the city, the group went straight to the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace, where they were greeted by Grand Secretariat Gun. Later, after Korra was given orders by Earth Queen Hou-Ting to retrieve tax payments, Asami went with the Avatar to the town they were held in. Just as they were about to return to Ba Sing Se, they were confronted by Gombo and his bandits. The girls were able to fight them off, Asami able to shock one of the motorcyclists. After they secured the tax money, Gombo yelled at Korra that the money was for the people, not the queen, causing Korra to wonder to Asami if they were truly on the right side.[17]\n" +
            "The next day, Asami practiced sparring with Korra as the Avatar vented her frustrations about the Earth Queen exploiting her and lying about the existence of airbenders in the city. When Korra kicked one of Asami's arm pads out of her hand with an airbending-assisted swing kick, she promptly asked for a break, saying Korra's letting off steam was starting to hurt. At that moment, Mako and Bolin arrived, the latter exhaustively trying to explain what happened to them in broken sentences, before Mako clarified that they learned that the Earth Queen was imprisoning airbenders to conscript into her army. At that point, the queen and Grand Secretariat Gun arrived, the latter of whom told the group that airbenders had been reported in the Yang Province, allowing the queen to insist that they could leave by that evening. Asami, however, bought them time by claiming that their airship needed repairs and they would have to stay one more night.\n" +

After finding out they were being held underneath the Earth Queen's Temple, they discussed what they could do to free them. Upon hearing a knock at the door, Asami believed it to be the queen, but it was actually Lin, who came to inform the group of the escape of four dangerous criminals who were after Korra; she insisted the Avatar return to Republic City. However, at Korra's insistence to free the airbenders, Lin joined their plan.\n" +
            "At nightfall, Asami retrieved her airship and, upon Lin receiving word from Bumi that they had the airbenders, took off alongside the police chief's airship. The group was able to flee the city successfully with the freed airbenders and made their way to its outskirts. That morning, the group split off, with Tenzin, Jinora, and the airbenders using Asami's airship to venture to the Northern Air Temple, while Asami continued with her friends and Lin to journey for more airbenders with the police airship.[18]\n" +

            "In Zaofu\n" +
            "While the group was taking a rest stop, Asami informed them that she got word on the radio about another airbender having been reported in Zaofu. The team ventured into the city sans Lin, who told them not to tell anyone of her presence. After disembarking from the airship, they were greeted by the city's emissary, Aiwei. As they ventured through the city by train, Asami viewed all the city's sights with awe and listened as Aiwei explained what had happened to Toph. The team was soon introduced to the city's matriarch, Suyin Beifong. At that point, Aiwei informed Suyin that there was one other person who had come with the team having detected Korra's lie with his seismic sense. Korra acknowledged that Lin was with them, and Asami was shocked to learn that Suyin and Lin were related. They ventured back to the airship where Asami watched as their troublesome relationship was explained.\n" +

            "Asami was surprised to see Varrick in Zaofu and asserted her position as the sole owner of Future Industries.\n" +
            "Asami joined the group again as Suyin led them to her home and introduced her family before being told that their accommodations were ready and that an appetizing meal would be prepared for them. The dinner was relatively peaceful until Lin's sarcastic remarks provoked hostility with Suyin. Varrick soon arrived, irking Asami, who wondered what he was doing there. Varrick danced around the question and asked how \"their\" company was doing, to which Asami reminded him that Future Industries solely belonged her because of his plot to kidnap the president, though the industrialist contested that he was never proven guilty. Asami listened as Varrick explained that he had been granted refuge by Suyin and was working for her as head of the technology department, while pitching to her the idea of a revolutionary high-speed rail.[19]\n" +
            "The next morning, Asami joined her friends, Suyin, and Opal for breakfast. While they were in the dining hall, they were forced to duck when their dishes were yanked over to Varrick's magnetic suit.[20]\n" +

            "Sometime later, Asami watched as Bolin and Korra sparred with Wei and Wing, respectively. She implored the four to clean up and prepare for Opal's farewell dinner. During the meal, Varrick introduced Asami and Korra to an airbender finder. Asami took the device and pointed it at Korra, but nothing registered, leading her to believe it was broken, to which Varrick explained one would need to airbend into it for it to work. At Suyin's call, Asami joined in a toast to Opal and later watched as the airbender left for the Northern Air Temple.\n" +

            "Asami and Team Avatar devised a plan with Lin and Suyin to rescue Korra.\n" +
            "That night, Asami awoke after hearing the calamity that stirred from the arrival of the Red Lotus into the estate and the capture of Korra. She found Mako and Bolin down in front of her door, though assured a worried Mako the criminals would not be able to get far because the guards, Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing had them surrounded. However, Ghazan divided the groups with a pool of lava. Asami joined the siblings and Lin in hiding behind metal floor decor. They were saved from a combustion attack by P'Li when Suyin and her twin sons bent another panel in its path to shield them. Asami believed there was no way to cross the moat, which prompted Suyin to devise a plan; her and Lin would dive through the metal dome on cables to rescue Korra. The teenager watched as the strategy played out successfully and Korra was rescued, though had to duck when Zaheer led his group's escape under a cloud of dust. Asami joined the team back at Suyin's office as Korra was given an antidote to recover from the paralysis of shirshu-spit darts.\n" +
            "The group soon realized that a guard was responsible for allowing the Red Lotus to reach them; specifically, a young man named Hong Li. In investigating his house with her friends and Aiwei, Asami found a book full of guard movements and schedules. With that and a message from Zaheer and company to prepare for rendezvous, Team Avatar believed they had enough evidence, but Aiwei insisted they wait until Hong Li cracked. While investigating the battle scene, she listened as Mako expressed his doubts over the guard's guilt. They were surprised there by Varrick, who had come digging for pumice stones. Asami watched in disgust as Zhu Li rubbed them on the industrialist's feet. He explained to the group that if one was to construct a conspiracy, they would tell everyone that someone was guilty and plant the evidence on them, prompting Mako to realize only one man could keep such a secret: Aiwei.\n" +

            "Korra metalbends\n" +
            "After failing to lie to Aiwei when Team Avatar was caught searching his home, Asami stood by and watched as Korra pried open the metal wall through which he escaped using metalbending.\n" +
            "Team Avatar made their way to Aiwei's house and entered in search for evidence. Asami only found an empty book, but when Mako, Bolin, and Korra found a secret passageway behind Aiwei's bookshelf, she saw the emissary returning and alerted the trio, but they were caught by him before they could leave. After Korra explained why they were there, he invited them to sit and share tea, asserting the guard's guilt. When he asked who they thought could be guilty, Asami lied, saying they did not know. Aiwei caught on to their suspicion and began to flee by raising a metal wall. Korra guided the team through by bending a hole in it, but as they entered the passageway, they found a bomb, which promptly detonated. Asami was shielded by Mako while the group as a whole was protected by Korra's air sphere. By the time they recovered, Aiwei was gone.\n" +
            "Regathering in Suyin's office, Asami stood by as Korra and Lin argued over the potential search for the group, and was led to believe they would be leaving Zaofu when Suyin agreed with her half-sibling about ensuring Korra's safety. Later, however, they were again approached by the matriarch, who informed the team she had a fully-loaded jeep for them to use in a search for Aiwei. Asami listened as Suyin explained she had only said what she did to please Lin and instead bought the team time to begin their search. Asami rode in the vehicle with Bolin and Mako while Korra rode on Naga, beginning the journey.[21]\n" +

            "With Naga's tracking abilities, the team followed Aiwei's trail to just outside the Misty Palms Oasis and made their way to a tavern, hoping to find information on his whereabouts. There, they saw wanted posters of them issued by the Earth Queen because they had freed her airbenders. As Korra was making threats about the queen, Asami noticed the patrons threatening them, prompting the team to leave.\n" +

            "Having found a note mentioning Xai Bau's Grove in Aiwei's jeep, Asami and Korra tried to find the place on a map, though without success.\n" +
            "On the oasis' outskirts, Team Avatar found Aiwei's jeep. While Bolin and Mako went into the oasis undercover, Asami scrounged around the jeep for clues. While unsure of why Zaheer and his crew were after Korra, she found a note which instructed Aiwei to go to Xai Bau's Grove at sundown. They tried to find the location on a map, Asami shooing some spirits away in the process, but they were unable to spot it. Mako returned to alert the girls they had found Aiwei going into the Misty Palms Inn, while Asami told him about their own findings. Trying to keep the advantage, Mako suggested a stakeout mission.\n" +
            "The four tried to request the room across from Aiwei's at the inn, but the innkeeper initially denied them service because teenagers had previously trashed another room. They were soon spotted by Macao and Lily. Fearful they may have been bounty hunters, all four took an attacking stance, but the two turned out to actually be fans of Bolin's movers and asked him for his autograph. This fact prompted the innkeeper to grant them a room after all, but the room across from Aiwei's proved to be small, cramping the four, Pabu, and Naga in. After Bolin found a Pai Sho board, Asami decided to play the game with him. When Bolin bragged about his learning of the street variation with Shady Shin, Asami told him she was taught by her \"diabolical genius\" father and would \"destroy\" him. At her friend's offer, she took the first move. Asami played the game slowly and with strategy as per her beliefs, confusing Bolin, who thought the game was fast-paced and one of chance. She dismissed the variation as not real, prompting the earthbender to pull out the rulebook. After he read off that the game was described as both one of strategy and chance, Asami took the book, reading the game had many different variations in many cultures. Upon him reading winning the game required knowing one's opponent, the young industrialist suggested she knew Bolin well because she had just pulled a winning move. Asami was subsequently engaged in several games, but won every time over the next few hours. Eventually, in the last game, she appeared to have been beaten, but Pabu jumped on the board, sending the game pieces flying.\n" +

            "Near sundown, after no break in the stakeout, Asami feared Aiwei may have slipped out, but Mako told her otherwise as he had logged a recent movement. Korra decided to confront Aiwei directly, the others trying to stop her. They instead found Aiwei meditating, which brought the Avatar to realize that, when she and Asami were looking the map earlier, the spirits had come to warn them that Xai Bau's Grove was in the Spirit World, which was where the emissary had gone. Asami and her friends kept watch over her physical form as Korra meditated into the other realm herself. After nightfall, they saw Ming-Hua and Ghazan approaching. Asami was advised by Mako to get Korra to safety, which she did by taking her body and riding out with Naga. However, after getting out of the oasis, they were soon trapped in four slabs of rock and placed in a prison transport. When Korra returned to her physical form, believing the Red Lotus had captured them, she asked Asami where they were. Confused about who that group was, Asami informed her friend they were actually taken by the Earth Queen's forces and being returned to Ba Sing Se.[22]\n" +

            "At Fort Bosco, Korra and Asami were loaded onto a Ba Sing Se airship for transport to the capital city. Being chained to the floor of the prison hold, Asami, fearing discomfort, asked the guard, Arik, to be chained to a railing instead, convincing him she would be unable to go anywhere regardless. She subsequently thanked the guard for doing so before he left.\n" +

            "Although she could easily free herself by ripping a bar off the wall, Asami realized she would need keys to free Korra.\n" +
            "Knowing the queen's airships were produced by Cabbage Corp and thus cheaper than Future Industries' work, Asami came up with a plan. She was able to break the railing off from the wall and jump over it, giving her some freedom to move her hands again, criticizing the ship's construction as \"shoddy workmanship\". Still, she knew she needed the keys to get Korra out of the locks, and thus used the broken railing to open a floor panel. Heading below the prison hold, Asami instructed her friend to call for help in five minutes.\n" +
            "After getting the keys and hearing Korra's help signal, she knocked out the distracted Arik and unlocked the Avatar's restraints. They made their way to the cockpit and, after Korra beat back the captain and co-pilot, Asami tried to take control, only to find Korra's attacks had damaged the steering and radio system while the airship was descending rapidly. She urged the Avatar to grab onto something as the airship crashed into a sand dune.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When the two emerged on the ship's roof, Asami stated any landing one could walk away from was good, but was skeptical in this case because they were stuck in the desert. She was not sure if the airship could be started again as it needed to be dug out even if Korra metalbent the propellers back into place. After the crew re-emerged and with a need to get to Ba Sing Se as soon as possible, Asami urged the group to work together in getting the airship rebuilt, only to be told by the captain the ship was going nowhere and neither were the girls as they were still prisoners. Asami, however, soon spotted a creature roaming underneath the stand, which convinced the crew to join in an attempt to repair the airship.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The industrialist was able to get the ship functional again and told Kong to get the engine started, but just as this was done, the creature from earlier, a sand shark, emerged and destroyed the airship. Following the initial shock, the group ran as the ship and its supplies fell around them. At the captain's suggestion they would need to wait just a few hours for help, Asami was not sure they had such time. She suggested the construction of a makeshift sand-sailer with the remnant metal, needing a sail and a sled.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Asami piloting a sand-sailer\n" +
            "Asami was able to build a sand-sailer with the scrap metal of the airship and pilot everyone out of the Si Wong Desert.\n" +
            "Upon completion, Asami commented the ship was not pretty but would do the job. The group appeared to have successfully fled the creature pursuing them, only for it to make an attempt to swallow them whole. However, Korra used her firebending to throw it down, giving them a safe escape to the Misty Palms Oasis. With the sailer breaking upon arrival, she jokingly asked the Sandbender Tribes if they wanted to buy it. The captain thanked her for getting them out and complimented her on having a good head before he and his crew left the girls.\n" +
            "Asami and Korra made their way to a tavern, where they found Tonraq, Lin, and Lord Zuko. Asami asked if they had found Bolin and Mako, to which Lin told them that the Red Lotus had taken them per eyewitness reports she received. The two girls were asked by Tonraq if they heard what had happened to the Earth Queen. Confused, they promptly heard over the radio that the queen was overthrown and Ba Sing Se was in chaos.[23]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Reunion and attempt to warn Tenzin\n" +
            "After Naga and Pabu found that Bolin and Mako had made their way to the Misty Palms Oasis, Asami and Korra emerged from the tavern. Asami hugged Bolin tightly while she was slightly lifted off her feet. She was soon mistaken for the Avatar by Mako and Bolin's grandmother, Yin, who said she was a nice girl. She also grew a bit nervous when Yin asked Mako why he was not dating someone nice like them, turning the conversation to what had happened to the brothers. After they explained the dire risk of Zaheer wiping out the new Air Nation and with the group needing a solid radio signal, Asami went with them to Zaofu.\n" +
            "Asami watching over Korra\n" +
            "A worried Asami watched over Korra's body while the Avatar attempted to find and trap Zaheer's soul in the Spirit World.\n" +
            "At Zaofu, the group learned Suyin and her guards had found a signal at the Northern Air Temple, but were not getting any answers. When Korra went to meditate and attempt to find Zaheer in the Spirit World, Asami came along with her, watching over her body while she ventured in. After Korra returned, Asami asked her friend if she found Zaheer, to which she was told she found someone else and needed to talk to another person.[24]\n" +
            "Double-cross and escape\n" +
            "Asami flew to the Northern Air Temple on a Zaofu airship with her friends, Lin, Suyin, Tonraq, and other Metal Clan guards. She stood by as they discussed plans to ambush the Red Lotus, looking oddly at Bolin as he proposed using bird calls and disguising himself as a hiker. When Korra suggested surrendering herself, Asami was shocked, saying she could not expect them to stand by while Zaheer took her. She gave a silent nod in support, nonetheless, toward the suggestion of saving the airbenders first. After Korra radioed Zaheer, Asami and the others were told by the Avatar of his new terms: she go to Laghima's peak alone at noon and turn herself over before he released the airbenders. Suyin suggested using their numbers advantage to launch an attack, telling Asami to go with Mako and Bolin to the temple via airship to retrieve the airbenders. Before they separated, the industrialist embraced Korra, telling her to be careful.\n" +
            "Asami supporting Tenzin\n" +
            "After picking the lock on Tenzin's shackles with a hair clip, Asami supported the wounded airbending master while leaving the Northern Air Temple.\n" +
            "Asami piloted the airship to the Northern Air Temple and landed them in the courtyard. When Ghazan came out to lead the way, she and Bolin looked at each other confusedly and eyed him suspiciously, but followed nonetheless. The two were led to Tenzin and what appeared to be the other airbenders. Asami and Bolin began trying to release Tenzin from his chains when they realized they were double-crossed; what they believed to be the airbenders were actually sacks of water maintained by Ming-Hua. As Mako and Bolin tried to fight off Ghazan and Ming-Hua, Asami used a hair pin to unlock Tenzin's bonds. At that point, Ghazan used his lavabending to block off the exit for the four, resulting in the hot liquid beginning to flood the temple. Asami was able to free the airbending master and asked where Oogi was, only to be told he had fled during the initial attack; he instead pointed them toward secret passageways out. She and Mako helped sustain Tenzin as they tried to outrun the lava with Bolin trying to block the flow with earth walls. They tried to sneak out through another passageway, only to be left at the mountain's edge and lava closing in on them. Bolin, however, saved them by bending the lava back and stopping its flow. At that moment, Kai arrived on his baby bison, Lefty, and led the group away from the collapsing temple.\n" +
            "The entire group reunited at a forest away from the temple, where they were informed that Korra had been taken away by Zaheer, who had recently achieved flight. Kai informed them he had seen the airbenders be taken to a secret cave by Red Lotus sentries. With Oogi having returned to them, the group was able to fly together to the location in question.[25]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Rescuing the airbenders\n" +
            "Asami piloted Oogi as Kai led them to the prison caves. Save for Tenzin, the group went in and ambushed the Red Lotus sentries; the industrialist used her electrified glove to stun one of them. She took the keys and helped free the airbenders one-by-one. While Tonraq, Mako, and Bolin went to find Korra, Asami and the others helped get the captives out. She waited outside the cave and watched as the airbenders combined to make a tornado which helped save Korra and throw Zaheer to the ground. Asami ran over to the poisoned Avatar, watching with worry as Suyin tried to bend the metallic poison out of Korra. She stood over her and Tonraq after the poison was drawn out of her.\n" +
            "Asami helps Korra\n" +
            "Asami aided a recovering Korra after the Avatar was severely injured due to her battle with Zaheer.\n" +
            "Two weeks later on Air Temple Island, Asami helped Korra, who was confined to a wheelchair, prepare for her appearance at Jinora's airbending mastery ceremony. Seeing her friend still upset over what had happened, she assured her no one expected her to recover right away and squeezed her hand, saying she was there for her and urging the Avatar to enjoy the day for Jinora. She wheeled Korra out to meet with her family, Tenzin's family, the Beifong sisters, Raiko, and Zuko. The girls, Ikki, and Meelo were helped up the stairs when Lin used a slab of rock to elevate them.\n" +
            "At the ceremony, Asami watched as Tenzin praised Jinora and Korra for all they had done to help restore and save the Air Nation and as the former's airbending master tattoos were revealed.[26]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After Jinora's ceremony, Asami went to the ferry dock to say goodbye to Korra, though emphasized to the Avatar that she really would not mind accompanying her to the Southern Water Tribe. However, when Korra stated that she needed some time for herself, Asami understood and waved her off with the rest of Team Avatar and their friends. In the following months, she wrote Korra and in one of her letters, she stated that she missed her friend, noting that Republic City was not the same without her. She reported that she was able to land a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, a task that would keep her busy for a while. Asami was the only one out of Team Avatar who received replies to her letters and the one in whom Korra confided about her situation.[27] Meanwhile, Asami also allowed Mako and Bolin's extended family to stay at her family's estate after their own house in Ba Sing Se had burned down during the chaos during the anarchy in the Earth Kingdom.[28]\n" +

            "Asami and her company were thanked by President Raiko in his speech for helping to modernize Central City Station, before she had the honor to cut the ribbon.\n" +
            "Asami continued her work to redeem Future Industries and by 174 AG, she was thanked by President Raiko during a public opening ceremony for modernizing Republic City's Central City Station. After cutting the ribbon for the grand reopening, Asami answered some questions from the press, though her conversation was cut short when she was approached by Prince Wu, who flirted with her using his status as the first in line for the vacant Earth Kingdom throne. When asked to give the prince a private tour of the station, Asami dismissed the request by stating that she was fond of the idea of putting Wu on a train and sending him off. The prince was not deterred and Asami was eventually saved from his unwanted flirtatious comments by Mako, who told the prince that President Raiko desired to discuss the Earth Kingdom throne with him. Asami asked Mako how he tolerated his position as Wu's body guard and afterward expressed her happiness to see him again, asking if he had heard from Bolin. Upon being told that he was set to arrive in a couple of days and that Korra would be returning that night, she expressed her desire to see the Avatar again, happy to be getting Team Avatar back together.\n" +
            "That night, Asami attended dinner on Air Temple Island with Tenzin's family, Lin, Wu, and the presidential couple. She was sitting at the table with the airbending family when an Air Acolyte announced the arrival of a Southern Water Tribe ship, much to her excitement. She and the group gathered at the dock to greet Korra, though after Tonraq stepped off the ship and told them that his daughter had left for Republic City six months prior, Asami was left concerned as no one had an idea about the Avatar's whereabouts.[29] Asami later attended Wu's coronation as the new Earth King and bore witness to Kuvira's declaration of usurping power over the Earth Kingdom, renaming it \"Earth Empire\".[30]\n" +

            "Asami teared up upon hearing her father admitting that he had been wrong about her and that he was proud of her.\n" +
            "Some time later, Asami traveled to the Republic City prison after receiving several letters from Hiroshi, none of which she had opened. Although she was warmly greeted by her father, she did not acknowledge it and merely slid the letters toward him, stating that he needed to stop writing her as she did not want to see or hear him ever again. As she moved to leave, Asami stayed upon Hiroshi's request to hear him out. Hearing him praise her, stating her to be the \"greatest thing [he] ever created\", she teared up and ran out of the meeting room. She retreated to Avatar Korra Park, where she witnessed a father playing with his daughter. Overcome with nostalgia of how she and her father used to be, Asami returned to the prison. As a surprised Hiroshi commented on the fact that she came back, Asami admitted that she had initially came to tell him face-to-face that she wanted nothing to do with him anymore in an attempt to hurt him like he had hurt her. However, she admitted that when she had laid eyes on him, she had only felt sadness over how he had tainted their past and destroyed their future together. Although she was unsure if she would ever be able to forgive him, she was willing to try and proposed to play a game of Pai Sho for old time's sake.[31]\n" +
            "A tense reunion\n" +
            "Asami snapping at Korra\n" +
            "Asami snapped at Korra when she thought the Avatar was second-guessing her judgment in regards to dealing with her father.\n" +
            "Learning of Korra's return to Republic City, Asami made plans to have lunch with her and Mako. She read an engineering magazine while awaiting her friend's arrival. When Korra showed up and asked if Asami had been waiting long, the businesswoman surged to her feet and hugged the younger woman, good-heartedly stating that she had only been waiting for three years. Expressing her joy over reuniting with her, Asami appraised her friend, complimenting her on her new, shorter hairdo, causing the Avatar to blush, before the industrialist led her inside the restaurant to meet up with Mako, who had reserved a table for them. Asami grew annoyed, however, when it became apparent that Prince Wu would be crashing their reunion. As Korra refused to enter the Avatar State on the royal's request, Asami inquired if she had regained that ability, revealing that she had been worried when Korra had told her she could not. This statement sparked frustration on Mako's part, however, since he felt left out by the girls for not having been contacted by Korra or told about the contact by Asami. When Korra progressed the conversation, asking to know everything about their lives while she had been gone, Asami announced that she had big news, revealing that she had visited her father. She grew irritated, however, when Korra asked if she was certain Hiroshi could be trusted and was not manipulating her again, causing her to snap at the Avatar that she was well aware of what her father was capable of. She added that it was not Korra's place to second-guess her actions and decide what was best for her, since she had disappeared for three years. Their brewing argument was interrupted and the subject was changed when Prince Wu announced he needed to go to the bathroom.\n" +
            "Mako irritated\n" +
            "Asami worked on Mako's nerves when she ignored his directions, stating she knew the layout of the streets better than him.\n" +
            "When Wu stayed absent for a suspicious amount of time, the team made their way toward the bathrooms, where Asami and Korra remained in the hallway while Mako inspected the men's restroom. As Korra was attacked, having followed a lead on her own, Asami and Mako rushed out the back door to see if they could help, though they promptly turned around to retrieve Asami's car, when Korra announced that Wu had been kidnapped. Asami pulled up next to Korra, urging her to get inside the vehicle, and quickly gave chase. She narrowly avoided colliding against the wall erected by one of the kidnappers in order to shake them. When Mako grew frustrated with her, having told her to take a particular route which she did not, Asami told the firebender that she knew the streets better than he did, having built some of them. As such, she maneuvered her car on a bridge that led them to drive parallel with the kidnappers' vehicle, albeit on a higher road. While Korra jumped down to take care of the kidnappers, Asami followed the road and pulled up next to Korra and the now apprehended suspect moments later.\n" +
            "As it became apparent that Wu was not in the truck anymore, Asami pointed out that the prince was likely placed in another vehicle when they lost sight of them, adding dejectedly that it would be a difficult search as he could be in one of the thousands of cars riding around in the city or any other mode of transportation. She watched as Korra placed a hand on a nearby spirit vine and subsequently declared that Wu was being taken to the train station, prompting her to confusedly ask how Korra knew. En route, she was told that Korra had learned to connect to people's energy via the spirit vines and wanted to know more about Toph Beifong, who had taught the Avatar that technique.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Asami charging a Kuvira agent\n" +
            "Defending Prince Wu, Asami took down one of Kuvira's agents.\n" +
            "The conversation was cut short when they arrived at the train station, where Asami slid on her electrified glove and followed her friends inside. Not knowing which train Wu was on, the three split up to cover more ground, though after a futile search, Asami approached Korra, noting that they needed to find the prince soon, lest they would never find him again. As the Avatar guided them to the train leaving for Omashu, they jumped on and started searching the wagons. They made their way to the luggage cart, where Asami urged her bickering friends to silence, enabling them all to hear a tapping coming from inside a chest, which turned out to be caused by Wu. When Kuvira's agents started to close in on them, Asami was helped atop the roof of the train by Korra. There, Asami took down one of their attackers by shocking him with her glove. She was pushed back, however, when another assailant started to metalbend the floor from underneath her feet and was grabbed by Korra, who encircled their little party with air, enabling them all to make a safe landing when they jumped off the speeding train and down a bridge.\n" +
            "Dusting herself off, Asami noted that their rescue mission reminded her of their old times together, save for the \"getting on each other's nerves part\". When Korra apologized for the earlier tension, Asami waved it off, since she deemed it natural that they would need a transition period after being separated for three years. Reconciling their differences, Asami, Mako, and Korra shared a hug, while keeping Prince Wu at a distance. Searching for a place where they could safely leave the royal, Asami and the others went to the Sato estate, where the prince would stay with Mako's family already residing there.[28]\n" +

            "Asami, Tenzin, and Korra\n" +
            "Emphasizing all the good that Korra had done as the Avatar, Asami managed to convince her that she would always be needed to restore balance in the world.\n" +
            "Asami traveled back to Air Temple Island with Korra, where she brought her some tea after the young woman had retreated to the meditation pavilion, believing she might have been cold. Noticing Korra's distant demeanor, Asami inquired whether she was okay and firmly told Korra that Toph's notion of the Avatar being redundant and it being pointless to try and stop Kuvira was ridiculous. To emphasize her point, she countered Korra's self-deprecating memories of her failures in regards to Amon with all the good things that had come from that confrontation, such the decapitation of the Equalist movement and allowing for free election to be held in the United Republic, which increased the representation of nonbenders, all actions that gave people hope. As Korra continued to reminisce about the bad consequences of failing to bring balance with Unalaq, Asami brought attention to the good consequences, namely the resurfacing of airbending and the positive shift in the world Korra had caused. When Korra pointed out that Zaheer had also received airbending and caused the world to be more out of balance than ever, Asami was shocked to learn that Tenzin agreed with Korra, though as the airbending master clarified that the importance of facing hardship was to learn from it, Asami was thanked by Korra for her efforts of cheering her up.[32]\n" +

            "As one of the two most brilliant minds in Republic City, Asami was called to City Hall by President Raiko to work together with Varrick to find a defense against Kuvira's spirit vine-charged super weapon. When Varrick pointed out to Raiko that he only allegedly tried to kidnap him, Asami scoffed at the eccentric inventor, snapping that everything he ever did was \"allegedly\", such as taking over her company and bombing the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. Regardless, Asami accepted to be partners again with him, though when shaking Varrick's offered hand, she placed it in a lock to emphasize her threat that he better not double-cross her again.[33]\n" +
            "After witnessing dragonfly hummingbirds, Asami got the idea to create a flying mecha suit that could fly in any direction, even straight up. However, when she, Varrick, Korra, Mako, Wu, and Tenzin met with Raiko again in his office, she was cheated out of revealing the plans to the president by Varrick, though he still gave her credit for the idea.[34]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "After developing some prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suit in her office, Asami moved production of the suits to one of her factories. Later, when it became known that Kuvira planned to attack Republic City in two weeks, Asami talked to Korra, Mako, and Bolin and decided that they would try to take out the spirit energy cannon in order to increase the United Forces' chances of winning against Kuvira. Discovering the army the next day to only being hours away from the city, a week before they had been expecting them, Asami was shocked to see the enormous mecha suit that was transporting the cannon. After narrowly avoiding being shot out of the sky twice, Team Avatar returned to Air Temple Island, where they reported on Kuvira's progress. With the attack imminent, Asami stated that she would return to her factory in an attempt to finish construction on a few hummingbird mecha suits; she was joined by Mako, Bolin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing. From there, she witnessed in shock how Kuvira destroyed the United Forces battleships in a matter of seconds.\n" +

            "Desperate to find a way to stop Kuvira's enormous mecha suit and the spirit energy cannon it carried, Asami suggested to cripple it.\n" +
            "After Korra joined them and revealed that Raiko had surrendered, leaving the fate of the city in their hands, Asami noted that perhaps they could cripple the enormous mecha suit carrying the spirit energy cannon. After Korra and a stealth team of airbenders kidnapped Baatar Jr. and brought him to the factory as well, Asami stood by while Korra and Suyin tried to convince him to reveal how they could defeat the enormous mecha suit. After Baatar Jr. contacted Kuvira and seemingly succeeded to convince her to cease her conquest of the United Republic, Asami was forced to run for her life when Kuvira traced Baatar Jr.'s radio call toward the factory and blew it up with her spirit energy cannon.[35]\n" +
            "Asami managed to survive the explosion and emerged from the rubble with everyone else when Bolin lifted a large piece of concrete. Although all the hummingbird mecha suits at the factory had been destroyed, Asami mused that she and Varrick could modify the prototypes at her office in order to get them airborne and provide the benders, who would try to take out Kuvira's spirit cannon in the meantime, with air support.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Despite their best efforts, Asami and Varrick had trouble getting the hummingbird suits to work. Believing Varrick had fixed the hydraulics, Asami and Zhu Li tested out one of the suits, though she soon discovered that she was unable to stabilize the machine and it spun out of control, causing them to crash. When Daw warned them that a platoon of mecha suits was incoming, Varrick ordered Asami to disconnect all the electrical devices in her office to protect them against the electromagnetic pulse he would create.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Hiroshi and Asami reconcile\n" +
            "Moments before heading out to attack Kuvira's giant mecha suit, Asami and Hiroshi reconciled their differences and told the other they loved them.\n" +
            "When the benders regrouped at her office, Asami was surprised to see her father appear as well. When he suggested to use Future Industries' plasma saws to cut through the platinum armor of Kuvira's enormous mecha suit, Asami interjected that those were too large and heavy to be carried by the relatively small hummingbird suits. Following Hiroshi's lead, she, Varrick, and Zhu Li added an electrical element to the welding torches already on their suits and converted them into plasma saws. As Daw alerted them that Kuvira was incoming once more, Asami noted that they needed at least a few more minutes, prompting the benders to face the enormous mecha suit again in order to stall its advance. After she and her father conducted a successful test by cutting a piece of plasma, Asami thanked him for all that he had done, though he instantly returned the compliment, praising her for the design of the hummingbird suits. As he emphasized how wonderful he thought it was to be working again with her, placing his hand over hers, Asami told her father she loved him, a sentiment he immediately returned. The two subsequently boarded the same mecha suit, with Asami being the pilot and Hiroshi manning the welding torch.\n" +
            "Horrified Asami\n" +
            "Asami watched in horror as her father was crushed to death by Kuvira's enormous mecha suit.\n" +
            "Asami piloted their hummingbird suit to the right thigh of Kuvira's enormous mecha suit, enabling Hiroshi to deploy the magnets on the feet of their suit and start welding, though was quickly forced to abort their attempt, lest they would be crushed. After Korra froze the enormous mecha suit with water from a nearby canal, Asami and Hiroshi tried again on the same spot. As Kuvira started to break the ice locking her in, Asami warned her father that they needed to leave, though he merely answered that he had almost succeeded in cutting a hole. When Kuvira freed one of her suit's arms, Asami yelled that they really had to leave that instant, though Hiroshi made the conscious choice to finish the mission and continue welding. He sadly said his goodbyes to her and with a final \"I love you\", he flipped the switch to her ejection seat. While floating away to safety with her parachute, Asami watched in horror as her father was crushed to death as he finished cutting the hole.[36]\n" +
            "Having made a safe landing, Asami ran through the streets of Republic City, though was forced to hide inside the hall of a nearby building, when she rounded a corner and was met with a wave of energy caused by the firing of the spirit energy cannon inside Republic City's Spirit Wilds. As the smoke cleared out, Asami made her way to the heart of the Spirit Wilds, where now a new spirit portal was located. Realizing Korra and Kuvira were nowhere to be found, Asami, aided by the rest of Team Avatar and their allies, set out to search the area. After all the spirits returned a moment later, she was glad to see that Korra emerged from the portal as well. After Kuvira was handcuffed and escorted away, Asami placed a hand on Korra's shoulder and embraced her from behind when the others joined in and made it a group hug.\n" +

            "Asami and Korra holding hands\n" +
            "Asami and Korra held hands and gazed at each other as they entered the spirit portal, marking the start of their romantic relationship.\n" +
            "Asami attended Varrick and Zhu Li's wedding at Air Temple Island, where she sat between Mako and Korra. After the ceremony, she approached Tenzin and Korra, alerting the airbending master that Varrick intended to use a glidersuit to jump off the tower. Left alone, Asami accepted Korra's invitation to sit with her, as the Avatar did not feel ready to return to the party. Gazing out over the skyline of Republic City, Asami was surprised to find Korra apologizing for being absent for three years. She quickly noted that there was no need to apologize, emphasizing that she was glad Korra was there now, as she could not have coped with the loss of her father and Korra on the same day. Wiping away the tears that had welled up in her eyes, Asami leaned into Korra's embrace and noted that she was relieved she had been able to forgive Hiroshi before he died. When Korra inquired about their next move, Asami stated that she did not feel like returning to the party and could use a vacation. When Korra suggested to go anywhere she wanted, just the two of them, she proposed to travel to the Spirit World. The two changed back into their casual clothing and, upon approaching the portal, they held hands. Stepping in, they turned to each other and held both hands while gazing romantically into each other's eyes.[9]\n" +

Even though she is quite used to luxury due to her wealthy background, she does not think of herself as \"daddy's little girl\", despite what some may think,[1] and maintains a humble and modest demeanor, using her wealth and abilities to help others. Asami has also developed a tough side and is unafraid to stand up for what she believes in.\n" +

Her caring nature was still prevalent, even after her break up with Mako, as she wished him well before he embarked on a dangerous mission.[12] Despite this, she felt resentment toward her father, burdened by his betrayal, the consequences of which carried through on a personal and business level. In contrast to her usual caring and sympathetic nature, she could muster no sympathy or forgiveness toward her father for years, desiring to hurt him as much as he had hurt her. However, after receiving a heartfelt apology and noticing how much he was suffering from his own guilt, she was willing to at least try to give him another chance.[31]\n" +

Her prowess was great enough to easily disarm the Equalists' Lieutenant and knock him out with his own weapon,[1] and she was similarly able to evade attacks from five chi blockers before using an electrified glove to stun them.[11] Asami has also proven herself to be nimble; she was able to jump over a speeding motorcycle while kicking the rider off, still managing to land gracefully,[17] and also dodged an earthbending attack by a Red Lotus sentry before stunning him in one fluid motion.[26]\n" +

As such, she has developed an keen eye on technology workmanship, being able to discern high-quality products from subpar ones, as evidenced when she criticized Cabbage Corp's airships for utilizing lighter materials.[17]\n" +

To survive, Bolin was heavily dependent upon his brother who, as the oldest, took on a parental role. To generate some form of income, the brothers initially ran small-time scams on the streets of Republic City during their youth[15] and, for a time, also consorted with the Triple Threat Triad.[16]\n" +

            "One day in 167 AG,[17] during Bolin's involvement with the Triple Threat Triad, the fourteen-year-old earthbender[3] and his brother attempted to pull off a scam on an elderly woman. After Mako snatched the lady's purse, Bolin posed as rescuer and retrieved the item after pretending to fight for it with his brother. The woman gave him only two yuans, infuriating Bolin and prompting him to steal a loaf of bread from her as well. He returned to Mako with the bread and gave some to him, attesting that it tasted better than what they had consumed the day before, even though they had not eaten anything that day.\n" +
            "Later that evening, Bolin went to the Triple Threat Triad headquarters with his brother and saw Shady Shin bribe Toza, a pro-bender. When Bolin expressed his disappointment about seeing Toza act this way, Mako became upset, believing Toza should be happy about receiving the bribe. Afterward, Shin told them that if they did not acquire enough bets to recover the ten thousand yuans given to Toza, he would abandon Bolin and Mako on the streets, after which the two brothers speedily departed.[18]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "As the brothers collected bets for the match at a local pet shop, they found that a fire ferret was trying to escape. It ran onto Bolin's head but was quickly reeled in by its owner, Mr. Feng, who thanked the earthbender for catching him. The owner told Bolin that the ferret would be fed to his pythonaconda, much to Bolin's dismay. He asked Mako if they could buy him for five yuans, but the firebender denied the request because they could not afford to feed him, and that Bolin needed to realize that larger animals consumed those smaller than them. While his older brother collected the owner's bet, Bolin noticed Toza signing autographs. He walked up to the pro-bender, who quickly recognized him as one of the Triple Threat's workers. Bolin tried to tell Toza that he did not need to throw the match because \"he [was] the best\", but Toza brushed him off, remarking that he was no longer an apt competitor, and that he needed the money. The earthbender sadly watched his idol walk away before Mako chastised him. Bolin angrily responded that he was not as mean as his brother and could not turn his back on those who were down.\n" +

However, the pythonaconda came out from the cage and wrapped itself around Bolin. Just as the snake was about to choke him, Mako arrived and unwrapped the serpent, stuffing it back into the cage, while Bolin spun around and stumbled over a few boxes. When Mako told him that he had a knack for getting into stupid situations, Bolin agreed and thanked his brother for saving him. Still, the earthbender refused to leave the pet shop without the ferret. Mako agreed to keep it, but the money to take care of it would come from Bolin's half. A happy Bolin left the shop with his brother and the ferret, whom he named Pabu, saying that he got the idea for the name while the pythonaconda was strangling him.[1] Soon, the pair became close friends, constantly playing practical jokes on Mako.[19]\n" +

            "The following night, Bolin attended Toza's match with his brother, Shady Shin and Lightning Bolt Zolt. Initially the young earthbender disheartened witnessed the match, seeing his favorite pro-bender beaten and pushed around without resistance. However, when Toza suddenly turned the tide and defeated his opponents single-handedly, Bolin was overjoyed, loudly telling his brother that he had told Toza not to give up. However, Shady Shin overheard the conversation, enraged about its content. Bolin briefly tried to calm Shin down by saying that \"there [were surely] other factors\", but he escaped with his brother, causing the mobster to chase after them. The siblings eventually escaped into a gym, but soon Shin and two other gangsters found them. During the following fierce fight, Shin almost overcame Bolin's defenses, before he was interrupted by Toza. The pro-bender came to help the siblings, effectively bringing the battle to a standstill. However, Zolt entered the gym and brought the duel to an end. After a short conversation between the criminals and Toza, the pro-bender, having witnessed their skill, offered Mako and Bolin a home in the arena and to train them in pro-bending. The young earthbender enthusiastically asked his brother if they could accept the offer, and after some initial insecurity, he agreed. Bolin suggested celebrating the fact that they were no longer criminals, prompting Mako to remind his brother that they had to save their money. Bolin, however, revealed that he had bet everything they had on the Boar-q-pines, because he had a \"good feeling\" about it, thus winning lots of money.[20]\n" +

He immediately befriended her and showed her some pro-bending tricks. He was thrilled when she helped the Fire Ferrets to reach the Championship Tournament and join the team on a more permanent base.[21] When the team needed to come up with the thirty thousand yuans to enter the Championship, Bolin accepted Shady Shin's offer to do some muscle work for the Triple Threat Triad. He was kidnapped along with four other triad members and taken before Amon to have his bending removed. Before that could happen, though, he was rescued by Mako and Korra.[16]\n" +
            "Grateful for his rescue, Bolin decided to make a move on Korra and took her on a date, although the Avatar did not share his romantic feelings. The romantic tensions were tampering with the Fire Ferrets' effectiveness during the Tournament,[22] though they managed to reach the finale regardless. However, after their match against the White Falls Wolfbats ended with their defeat due to cheating of the other team, Amon and his Equalists attacked the Pro-bending Arena, effectively destroying the building and leaving Bolin and Mako homeless.[23] Asami offered them a place to stay, but after Hiroshi Sato was outed as an Equalist, both the bending brothers and Asami moved to live at Air Temple Island with Korra.[24]\n" +

They were successful, though the team was broken up when an angered Tarrlok arrested Asami, and subsequently Bolin and his brother as they came to the girl's defense.[25] He was broken out of jail by Lin Beifong soon after, who alerted them that Korra had been kidnapped. Together with Tenzin, they all set out on a search for the Avatar, during which Bolin accidentally let slip to Asami that Mako and Korra had shared a kiss.[26]\n" +

As such, Bolin had the time to accompany Team Avatar to the Southern Water Tribe to attend the Glacier Spirits Festival. He helped Asami save her company by striking a deal with Varrick, who quickly hit it off with him, and became romantically involved with Eska.[30] He soon found the relationship to be too oppressing and wanted to break up with the girl. However, when he tried to do so, she ended up engaging herself to him and Bolin was more than happy to leave the Southern Water Tribe for Republic City, sneaking away without saying goodbye to Eska.[31][32][33]\n" +

On the night of the final screening of The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South, Bolin went out to get some air and spotted a speedboat docked near the Pro-bending Arena. Mindful of Mako's words that he needed to be careful as something was not right with Varrick, Bolin set out to investigate and discovered there was a kidnapping attempt on President Raiko in progress. Freeing the president and his wife, Bolin moved the fight to the arena, where he used his pro-bending knowledge to overcome his opponents, although he was outnumbered.

After Bumi managed to free them all, Bolin and Mako faced Unalaq in an attempt to hold him off while Korra closed the Southern portal before Harmonic Convergence started.[36] Although she was unsuccessful and Vaatu managed to escape, the brothers continued to fight off Unalaq, now hoping to stop him from merging with Vaatu to become the Dark Avatar. They eventually met their defeat when Desna and Eska came to their father's help, but Bolin, apologizing for his earlier actions and declaring his love for her, managed to persuade the twins to let them go from their icy prison.

However, they were no match for the numbers of the dark spirits and were slowly pressed back into the hollow of the Tree of Time. Before they were completely overrun, however, they were all saved by Korra's returning spirit.

Bolin, Mako, and Asami ended up being fooled into believing the airbenders were at the temple, however, which led to them being cornered by Ghazan, who used his lavabending to bring down the entire temple. With Tenzin's help, the threesome managed to navigate their way to lower parts of the building, though their escape routes were soon blocked by the advancing lava. In a last attempt to save their lives, Bolin charged the lava and was shocked to learn he could lavabend. Saved from their precarious situation by Kai, they reunited with the others and learned that Korra and the airbenders had been taken to a nearby cave.[48]\n" +

            "Quickly ambushing the Red Lotus sentries, the group released the airbenders from the chains in which they were held, and Bolin was excited to reunite with Opal. With Korra still missing, however, Bolin and Mako promptly joined Tonraq to find her, being tipped off to her exact location by Jinora. When they found her, however, she was in the Avatar State due to the effects of her mercury poisoning and battling Zaheer, leaving Bolin and Mako to deal with Ghazan and Ming-Hua, respectively. Trading earth- and lava-based attacks, Bolin held off Ghazan until Mako, having disposed of Ming-Hua, came to his aid. Overwhelming Ghazan, the criminal collapsed the entire cave, though Bolin managed to bend himself and Mako to safety. They emerged to the conclusion of Korra's battle with Zaheer. After Suyin managed to save Korra, Bolin silenced the captured Zaheer by stuffing a sock in his mouth.\n" +

            "Two weeks later, Bolin attended Jinora's airbending master ceremony[49] before joining Asami, Mako, Tenzin, and Jinora on the ferry dock to say goodbye to Korra, who was set to return to the Southern Water Tribe in order to recover from her physical and mental trauma. Vowing to become pen pals, he handed her a letter and proceeded to write her more in the years to come, detailing in one of which how he had found employment with Varrick and Kuvira and had left Republic City to bring balance to the Earth Kingdom.[50]\n" +

            "In the three years following the insurrection of the Red Lotus, Bolin joined up with Kuvira and her army to help reunite the Earth Kingdom under her control. He also became romantically involved with Opal, though the long distance between them and his support of Kuvira put a strain on their relationship. In 174 AG, Bolin and the army arrived at the State of Yi, where Kuvira eventually managed to convince the governor to join the areas under her control. However, the annexation came with a personal cost for Bolin, as it placed even more strain on his relationship with Opal.[8]\n" +
            "Mako and Bolin argue\n" +
            "Bolin grew angry with Mako upon his continuous opposition of Kuvira, who was a better leader in Bolin's opinion than Earth King Wu.\n" +
            "When Bolin arrived at Republic City for Wu's coronation as the fifty-fourth earth monarch, he was reluctant to follow his fellow officers in the standing ovation for their leader when Kuvira denounced Wu's authority and dissolved the Earth Kingdom in favor of the Earth Empire under her leadership. After the ceremony, he was approached by Kuvira, who had noticed his worried expression, and she eventually managed to convince him to reaffirm his loyalty to her. He later sought out Mako in an attempt to sway him to stop being Wu's bodyguard and join him and the army instead, explaining to his brother that he had a wrong view of Kuvira, stating that the metalbender was truly helping all the poor people of the empire. When Mako continued to voice his skepticism about Kuvira's good intentions, labeling her to be a dictator taking over the Earth Kingdom by force, Bolin blamed him for wasting his time as Wu's glorified butler while he was making history and left.[51]\n" +
            "Bolin starts to doubt\n" +
            "Learning that Opal had told the truth, Bolin's loyalty to Kuvira began to waver.\n" +
            "As the army arrived at Zaofu, Bolin was invited by Kuvira and Baatar Jr. to accompany them on their talk with Suyin in an attempt to sway the Metal Clan's matriarch into giving up her city. The encounter did not go as planned, however, and while he attempted to make the Beifong family understand that Kuvira was providing a brighter future for the citizens of the Earth Kingdom, Opal countered him by noting that after the army left, the citizens were forced into slave labor and dissenters were sent away, something Bolin refused to believe. However, after Kuvira had issued a twenty-four-hour ultimatum to surrender Zaofu peacefully and retreated to their army camp, Bolin grew wary about her using \"other ways\" to convince people to join if they refused to cooperate and was told that the citizens of the annexed states were Kuvira's loyal subjects, whom she could order around as she saw fit. When he suggested to just leave Zaofu, he was blamed to love Opal more than he was loyal to Kuvira and threatened to be shipped off to a reeducation camp. Despite quickly reaffirming his belief in her to avoid such a fate, Bolin visited Varrick afterward, and they declared simultaneously that \"Kuvira [was] crazy\". Agreeing that they needed to get away from there, Varrick and Zhu Li escaped via the hatch with Bolin close behind.\n" +

            "Bolin was forced to defend himself when Baatar Jr. attacked him with the flamethrower from a mecha suit.\n" +
            "The three each secured a mecha suit and made their escape to the nearby forest, where Bolin proposed to sneak into Zaofu from the rear in order to help the Metal Clan fight off Kuvira's army. Before they could decide on what to do, they were ambushed by Baatar Jr. and two sergeants. Although Bolin and Zhu Li managed to hold their own, they were forced to surrender when Baatar Jr. threatened to kill Varrick if they would not comply to his wishes. They were escorted back to camp, where Kuvira ordered for Bolin to be sent to the reeducation camp for their most severe dissenters.[9]\n" +
            "Varrick with remote control\n" +
            "Bolin grew fearful upon realizing that Varrick intended to blow up the train with them on it.\n" +
            "Bolin and Varrick were placed on a train that took them away from Zaofu, and after Varrick spooked the guard that was assigned to be his assistant, Bolin was assigned to help him instead, much to his displeasure. He eventually grew alarmed when Varrick powered up his machine and revealed that it had been converted into a bomb that was set to detonate five minutes later. Varrick's threat made all the guards and train mechanics abandon the wagon they were on, causing Bolin to congratulate Varrick on his plan and urge the inventor to shut his bomb down. When he learned that Varrick had not been bluffing, however, he started looking for a way out. Spotting a hatch leading toward the tracks, he grabbed the inventor by the shoulders and exited the train moments before it exploded. After Bolin tunneled a way for them through the earth and exited at the bottom of the crater, he glared at Varrick and told him that he could not believe Zhu Li had worked for him as long as she had after the inventor had excitedly thanked him for \"doing the thing\".[10]\n" +
            "Earth Empire fugitives\n" +
            "After a standoff, Bolin and Varrick forged an alliance with Baraz, Ahnah, and other Earth Empire fugitives.\n" +
            "Bolin and Varrick started their journey toward Republic City on foot to warn the world about Kuvira's plan, though they were soon caught in a trap set by other escaped Earth Empire prisoners. Both parties eventually agreed to work together to cross a border checkpoint, though a guard post soldier recognized them as traitors to the empire and were prevented from making a clean escape. In the ensuing battle, Bolin defended himself with earth and lava against three mecha suits, though despite his relentless attacks, he failed to permanently take down the suits and ended up being cornered by them, trapped behind his earth shield by their flamethrowers. As one of the mecha suits was on the verge of taking him out, he was saved by Varrick, who had created an electromagnetic pulse device which shut down all the machines. Although the inventor urged him to leave with him, Bolin noticed that the fugitives were being pressed back by the remaining guards and created a large stream of lava with which he forced the soldiers to retreat and prevent them from following afterward. As they reached the shore where the escapees boarded a small boat, Baraz and Ahnah offered to give them a lift on their boat, as they were heading north as well, something the two friends accepted.[52] As they made it back to Republic City, Bolin and Varrick immediately headed for City Hall, where they warned the world leaders that Kuvira was building a super weapon. After the meeting, Bolin apologized to Mako for not listening to his warnings and joined a group hug with him and Korra.\n" +
            "Bolin wants to save Zhu Li\n" +
            "Learning of Zhu Li's fate, Bolin promptly announced that the Beifong family should leave without him, while he rescued the assistant.\n" +
            "In an attempt to make amends with Opal, Bolin joined her and Lin on a secret mission to free their family from prison.[11] As they arrived on the outskirts of Zaofu, he became overwhelmed when they were joined by Toph Beifong, as she was his hero. During a preliminary scouting of the factory, Toph and Lin deduced with their seismic sense that the Beifong family was being detained in an underground cavern, and Bolin was delighted to learn that Zhu Li was lying when she said that she was doing everything she could to help fix the spirit energy cannon. They came back the following day when Kuvira was demonstrating her new weapon, leaving the factory largely deserted. With Opal on the lookout, Bolin helped Lin and Toph to free the other Beifongs. Upon reuniting with Opal, he learned that Zhu Li had been captured and sentenced to die in the abandoned town that was to be blown up by the cannon and promptly left to save her, a mission for which he was joined by Opal. After getting everyone to safety, Bolin was forgiven by Opal, though was shocked when Zhu Li revealed that Kuvira planned to attack Republic City two weeks later.[53]\n" +
            "Inside the enormous mecha suit\n" +
            "Due to Hiroshi's sacrifice, Bolin was able to make it inside Kuvira's enormous mecha suit together with Korra, Mako, Lin, and Suyin.\n" +
            "Having warned Raiko about the imminent attack, Bolin, Korra, Mako, and Asami decided that they would try to take out the spirit energy cannon. Much to their shock, however, they learned that the canon was mounted on an enormous mecha suit and had already crossed onto United Republic territory. Returning to the city, Bolin witnessed in shock how Kuvira destroyed the United Forces battleships in a matter of seconds, before Kuvira blew up the factory they were all hiding in.[12] However, he survived the explosion and lifted an enormous piece of concrete by himself, allowing everyone to emerge from the rubble as well. When Tenzin warned them that Kuvira was heading their way with a battalion of mecha suits, Bolin opted to leave the city to Kuvira in order to live and fight another day. Since Korra refused to let the city fall, however, he joined her and the other benders to distract Kuvira while Asami and Hiroshi, and Varrick and Zhu Li, used a hummingbird mecha suit to cut a hole in Kuvira's suit. Although baffled to see Kuvira crush Hiroshi to death in his hummingbird suit, Bolin managed to dive inside the hole together with Suyin, Lin, Mako, and Korra.[54]\n" +
            "Mako and Bolin shake hands\n" +
            "Bolin shook hands with Mako, making him promise to flee to safety as soon as he could after blowing up the spirit vine-charged power core of the mecha suit.\n" +
            "Inside, Bolin and Mako headed to the power core of the machine, where they took battle with the present guards. After overpowering them and with Baatar Jr.'s instructions in mind to simultaneously pull the levers to power down the suit, the two brothers counted to coordinate their actions, though after nothing happened, Bolin deduced that Kuvira must have installed an override in the system. When Mako ordered him to take all the engineers to safety, he tried to dissuade Mako from going through with zapping the spirit vine core with his lightning, emphasizing the dangers. As his brother remained adamant, Bolin relented, though made him promise to get out as soon as he could. After telling Mako he loved him, Bolin left, though when the power core started to explode and Mako was rendered unconscious, half-draped over the hatch, Bolin came back for him and carried him off to safety. When Bolin and Mako exited the ruined mecha suit, they were shocked to find that the Spirit Wilds had been blasted open and housed a new spirit portal in its center. Realizing Korra and Kuvira were nowhere to be found, Bolin and the rest of Team Avatar set out to search the area for the Avatar. When the two women emerged from the portal and a handcuffed Kuvira was escorted away, he hugged Korra, with the rest of Team Avatar soon joining in. Some time later, Bolin acted as the official during Varrick and Zhu Li's wedding.[55]\n" +

            "Bolin's upbeat personality is a direct opposite to Mako's serious nature.\n" +
            "Despite his tough childhood on the street, Bolin is still a laid-back and fun-loving person and possesses a good sense of humor, in contrast to his older brother Mako.[56] He is also expressive, naive, high-spirited, enthusiastic, and comfortable in his own skin. At the same time, he is not without insecurities, having a degree of sensitivity over his inability to perform metalbending. According to Mako, he has a \"knack\" for getting himself into trouble.[16] He is typically an optimist and enjoys the attention he receives from his fangirls, though he is a novice in the world of dating. Bolin affirms that he is strong, fun, and attractive, though readily admits he is not good at reading other people. Bolin is also not the best at keeping secrets, as he accidentally blabbed to Asami about Mako and Korra's kiss while she was still dating his brother.[34]\n" +
            "His naive and immature personality is attributed to his past, as Mako attempted to shield him from the harsh realities of the world after their parents were murdered.[4] Despite differences between Mako's personality and his own, Bolin shares a close bond with his brother.[57] However, he lacks the firebender's confidence, which leaves him to often doubt his own abilities, needing to be reassured by others.[43][46] He can also get starstruck when in the presence of someone powerful or famous, such as when he first met Lord Zuko at the Misty Palms Oasis. Despite such nervousness, he is always respectful and deferential.[47]\n" +

            "While traveling through Earth Empire territory, Bolin refused to leave a group of escaped prisoners behind and readily engaged in combat at their behalf.\n" +
            "Although helpful and friendly, Bolin is also protective of the people about whom he cares and will spring to the defense of his friends and family. A prime example of this would be when he rode in on Naga to Asami's rescue at the Equalist airfield, employing ferocious and brutal earthbending attacks on Hiroshi Sato, who was nearly able to kill her with his mecha tank. On the other hand, Bolin is generally forgiving of others, even if they have wronged him or those he cares about, such as Korra, Varrick, or Eska.\n" +
            "Bolin is an idealist, always motivated by a strong desire to help people and make their lives better. When the Earth Kingdom fell into chaos, he joined Kuvira and her army, believing she wanted to help others as much as he did. As a result, his idealism and naivetÃ© prevented him from second guessing the extreme lengths Kuvira would go to in order to achieve their goals, until they were pointed out to him.[9]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Bolin can be gullible at times and was taken advantage of by Desna and Eska due to his affection for the latter. He was grateful to Korra for starting a war just to get away from Eska, but his joy immediately turned into fear upon seeing Eska coming for him in a fit of rage.[33]\n" +

            "As the earthbender for an official pro-bending team, Bolin has become highly skilled in the art of earthbending. Bolin describes his earthbending style as \"light on his feet\", which grants him greater maneuverability and evasiveness during matches. Bolin also employs pro-bending-like attacks along with more traditional earthbending outside of matches, as made evident by him sending rectangular blocks flying at the Lieutenant and defending himself with an earth wall.\n" +
            "Bolin also possesses a sharp aim, being able to direct an earth disc at the exact angle to make it ricochet off a guard rail and squarely strike an opposing player. His aim is so great that he can bend a tiny pebble and strike P'Li's third eye, thus making her combustion explode, which affected Ghazan and Ming-Hua. He can also fire small chunks of earth in rapid succession to take down a speeding motorcycle, thus demonstrating the ability to earthbend without touching the ground at all. He is also capable of subduing three waterbenders in tandem, using only the small discs available in the Pro-bending Arena. He is agile as he was able to dodge the Dai Li's attack in attempt to escape the Earth Queen's Temple. Bolin possesses considerable bending might, enabling him to lift an enormous piece of concrete, albeit with noticeable strain, and pushing over the top half of a building by working in tandem with Suyin and Lin Beifong.[54]\n" +

            "Although Bolin discovered by accident that he had the rare ability to bend lava, he was able from the start to quickly stop an oncoming flow of the heated substance.[48] Shortly afterward, despite being an amateur, Bolin proved himself able to phase change the earth between both states and manipulate it in battle. During his second fight with Ghazan, Bolin was able to hold his own using this skill against the more experienced lavabender. At first, he used a range of pro-bending tactics in his combat against Ghazan. As the battle continued, he used more traditional earthbending tactics, incorporating them into his lavabending.[49] By 174 AG, his proficiency in lavabending had improved to the point that he could create larger streams of lava that stretched much further[9] and even use it while being handcuffed. He also demonstrated the ability to lavabend with his feet and is able to turn lava back into earth much quicker and with less effort, while also being able to create large waves of molten rock.[52] Bolin can also manipulate and maintain lava in a disc shape and rotated it at high speeds to cut through metal.[55]\n" +
            "Other skills\n" +
            "Bolin also has some skill in wrestling and grappling, which he utilized during his one-on-one tiebreaker match with an experienced Black Quarry Boar-q-pine earthbending opponent. He also has a degree of resilience to pain, as during his semifinal pro-bending match, he was able to continue fighting despite being hit in his right shoulder by an earth disk. Bolin has also proven himself to be a good swimmer, capable of holding his breath for a significant period of time while simultaneously dodging Ghazan's lavabending attacks.\n" +
            "Bolin has a strong business sense, as has been noted by both Asami and Varrick, and is a talented and charismatic public speaker, able to draw huge positive reactions from crowds. Varrick decided to exploit this ability by casting Bolin as the star of his propaganda films, making him the poster boy of the Southern rebellion.\n" +

            "Born in 50 BG, Pathik was a spiritual brother of the Air Nomads and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso.[2] When the Air Nomads were wiped out, Pathik took up residence in the Eastern Air Temple.

            "At the Eastern Air Temple, Pathik met Appa and understood that he was not the person Appa expected. He simply lied back, looked at the creature every so often, and received a growl in return. Eventually, the night settled in, and Appa fell asleep. The guru read Appa's spiritual energy and remarked on how Appa was so full of love and trust, but that at the same time fear was moving in where trust should have been. He also told Appa about the vision of Aang and Appa he had had years earlier, which prompted his decision to travel to the Eastern Air Temple and wait for the two. He left the sky bison to rest, stating that the bison must let the clouds in his mind part and be at peace.\n" +
            "Come morning, Appa followed a trail of fruit made by the guru, which eventually led Appa to the guru meditating with a group of animals surrounding him. Appa decided to leave the man alone, and, after flying around a bit, he came to rest next to the guru at the top of the temple. The guru gave Appa a note, which he tied to his horn, and proceeded to tell Appa about how much his energy and Aang's were intertwined. As he told Appa this, he placed his hand on Appa's forehead, and told Appa where to find Aang. Appa flew off, heading to Ba Sing Se. However, the guru's note was intercepted by Long Feng, but was later returned to Aang.[3]\n" +

Guru Pathik introduced himself as a spiritual brother to the monks and a close friend of Monk Gyatso. Aang asked the guru how he planned to teach him to open and control the Avatar State, to which the guru replied that he must first bring balance to himself before he can bring balance to the world. He first asked Aang to drink a strange liquid. Aang did so without any qualms before he spat it out, surprised by the disgusting onion and banana concoction.\n" +
            "Chakras\n" +
            "At the Eastern Air Temple, he began Aang's instruction of the chakras, educating the young Avatar of the nexuses of metaphysical and biophysical energy in the human body. In order to master the Avatar State, Pathik told Aang that he must first open all seven chakras of the body. After he determined that Aang had absolutely no knowledge of the nature of chakras, Pathik proceeded with a visual representation. Using a pond clogged with algae, he successfully explained to Aang the concept of chakras. He stated that by removing the clogs between pools, the water was allowed to flow, just as energy was allowed to flow through the body when the seven chakras were opened. There were in total seven chakras within the body, each with a different purpose and type of blockage; an intense sensation resulted from the opening of them all. Pathik warned that the process of opening the chakras could not be halted once it had begun - it had to be completed in order to succeed. Aang accepted this risk and they began the process.\n" +
            "Guru Pathik successfully guided Aang through the opening of the first six chakras. However, once Aang learned that to open the seventh and final chakra he would have to let go of his feelings of attachment for Katara, he refused. Guru Pathik attempted to convince him otherwise, but when Aang had a vision of Katara in trouble, he left the Eastern Air Temple to rescue her. Pathik's final words before Aang's departure was a warning that Aang risked locking the final chakra and that he would not be able to enter the Avatar State at all.[1] By 171 AG, Guru Pathik no longer resided at the Eastern Air Temple.[4]\n" +

            "In addition, he could sense the energy connections between two individuals and enable them to find each other over great distances, such as when he revealed to Appa that Aang was in Ba Sing Se; this appears to be a more powerful version of an ability Aang used while in the Foggy Swamp, in order to find Appa and Momo\n";

He often resorted to his firebending to protect himself and Bolin on the streets.[2] Both of them also ran small-time scams during much of their youth. This attitude brought him in contact with the criminal organization known as the Triple Threat Triad, for whom he collected money for bets and ran numbers.

When Bolin expressed his disappointment about seeing Toza act this way, Mako became upset â€“ Toza should be happy about being paid, Mako opined; after all, there had been no one to mourn for their losses when their parents died and had left them to fend for themselves, and that one must \"hustle or be hustled\". Afterward, Shin told them that if they did not acquire enough bets to recover the ten thousand yuans given to Toza, he would abandon Mako and Bolin on the streets, after which the two brothers speedily departed.[11]\n" +
            "While the brothers were collecting bets at a pet shop, a fire ferret escaped and was restrained by its owner, Mr. Feng, because it was to be fed to a pythonaconda. Mako stopped Bolin from buying it as they could not afford to feed it, and felt his younger brother needed to toughen up and realize that bigger animals consumed those smaller than them. Mako collected the owner's bet while Bolin talked to Toza about that night's match; the firebender chastised him because he believed that doing so would get them in trouble with Shady Shin.

After again criticizing his brother for getting into stupid situations, the two left, but, at Bolin's urging, with the fire ferret whom the earthbender named Pabu. Mako warned Bolin that Pabu's food would come out of half of his money.[12]\n" +
            "Later that night, Mako and Bolin attended Toza's match, sitting in the same booth as Zolt and Shady Shin. However, when Toza won and Bolin revealed that he had encouraged the pro-bender to not to throw the match, Mako urged his brother to run from an irritated Shin. The brothers were eventually cornered by Shady Shin and two other gangsters and forced into the defensive until Toza helped bring the fight to a standstill and Zolt eventually broke it off completely. Impressed with the brothers' abilities, Mako and Bolin were offered the chance by Toza to live at the gym and train under him to become pro-benders. While Bolin was immediately won over by the idea, Mako doubted and Shady Shin used this to appeal to the young firebender's pragmatic nature and point out that he needed to protect his younger brother. Mako agreed with that assessment and used it as a reasoning to take Toza's offer for a chance at a more honest life. When Bolin wanted to celebrate the abandonment of their criminal lives, Mako reminded him they had to save what little money they had at that point, though due to Bolin betting on a Boar-q-pine victory, they had more than enough to celebrate with.[13]\n" +

Mako eventually became the captain of a pro-bending team, the Fire Ferrets, which included his brother and his friend Hasook.[14][15]\n" +

She eventually managed to help them win the match, and as such, a lasting partnership was formed.[15] When Bolin was kidnapped some time later, Mako set out with Korra to find him. They tracked the earthbender down to an abandoned warehouse, where they witnessed, first hand, Amon's ability to strip a bender of their bending abilities. However, with Korra's help, Mako was able to rescue his brother before Amon reached him.[1]\n" +

Due to this connection, Future Industries took care of the Fire Ferrets' monetary issues by sponsoring the team. The team started to train hard for the Pro-bending Championship, and although they had some hard matches due to internal romantic struggles,[16] they managed to reach the finale. However, after their match against the White Falls Wolfbats ended with their defeat due to cheating of the other team, Amon and his Equalists attacked the Pro-bending Arena, effectively destroying the building and leaving Mako and Bolin homeless.[17] Asami offered them a place to stay, but after Hiroshi Sato was outed as an Equalist, both the bending brothers and Asami moved to live at Air Temple Island with Korra.[18]\n" +

The foursome retreated into the tunnel system of the city, where they would await the arrival of reinforcements in the form of General Iroh and his United Forces.[21] Mako and Asami's relationship grew more and more tense as he spent more time with Korra doing reconnaissance work by spying on the Equalists. However, after General Iroh too proved to be no match for the Equalists machines, Mako set out with Korra to confront Amon. After having learned that he truly was a waterbender from the Northern Water Tribe,[22] they eventually found him at the Pro-bending Arena, where he was holding a victory speech. They freed Tenzin and his children, though when they were faced by Amon, the Equalist leader managed to take away Korra's bending. When Amon moved to do the same to Mako, the firebender managed to temporarily overpower Amon, and run away with Korra. However, he was stopped by Amon and was on the verge of losing his bending, when Korra saved him with her newly unlocked airbending.\n" +

Unsure what to do, he followed her and witnessed how she got her bending back, after which she confessed her love for him too and they began their relationship.[23]\n" +

Returning to the city, they reported on Kuvira's progress, and Mako witnessed in shock how Kuvira destroyed the United Forces battleships in a matter of seconds, before blowing up the factory they were all hiding in.[51] However, he survived the explosion and when Tenzin warned them that Kuvira was heading their way with a battalion of mecha suits, he refused to leave the city, fearing that Kuvira would discover and attack Wu. Since Korra refused to let the city fall, Mako joined her and the other benders to distract Kuvira while Asami and Hiroshi, and Varrick and Zhu Li, used a hummingbird mecha suit to cut a hole in Kuvira's suit.

Promising to get out as soon as he could, he fired a continuous bolt of lightning, causing the power core to overload and explode. Despite having his arm burned by the strain the lightning put on it, Mako kept up his attack and started to move out.

In light of the brothers' pasts, he cares deeply for Bolin and is very protective of him.[15] After Mako lost his parents, he was willing to do whatever was necessary to help him and his brother survive the rough environment of Republic City, even going as far as scamming and working for a notorious criminal organization. Eventually, Mako abandoned these immoral activities, but refused to admit the criminality of his past actions to Korra, as he firmly believed he was doing what was necessary to survive. Mako always puts the interests of safety and survival ahead of other things, as exemplified by his reluctance to let Bolin keep a fire ferret as a pet, since that would strain their already small food supply. Living on the streets has given him a \"hard-edge\",[14] though he seems to relax when he is with Bolin, Korra, or Asami, or when he achieves something important.

            "Mako has demonstrated considerable skill in the art of firebending, implementing a modern style of fighting that he developed in his pro-bending days. Critics of the sport note his use of a distinct \"cool under fire\" technique, which primarily involves a series of defensive weaving and dodging patterns quickly followed by successive spurts of offense, rendering Mako capable of defeating an entire pro-bending team by himself.[15] Outside of pro-bending, Mako demonstrated great skill in traditional firebending combat. He can maintain his fire streams for a period of time for feats such as propelling himself through the air. He can also perform more advanced techniques such as the breath of fire.[18] The raw strength of his firebending is also considerable, able to offset a large and point-blank explosion unharmed.[26] His control is also very fine, as he is able to form a sleek dagger for intimidation and the likes.\n" +

            "Mako is skilled enough to generate lightning and redirect it, having learned the skills from his former boss, Lightning Bolt Zolt.[9] He is able to generate it from either hand quickly with little charging time and no arm movement and is also capable of maintaining the bolt for several seconds. He has used lightning for a job at a power plant in Republic City[1] and can effectively use it in combat. He can also fire it with considerable aim, being able to hit speeding targets and controlling the charge of it to merely stun targets.[19] While fighting several Equalist mecha tanks, Mako redirected the electricity channeled through their metal cables to disable them.[21] When restrained by Amon's bloodbending, he was able to maintain enough focus and calmness of mind to generate lightning and score a direct hit against the Equalist leader. Amon admitted to Mako that he was impressed with his firebending skill, and that it was almost a shame that he would have to remove the bending of \"someone so talented\".[23] When he was cornered by Ming-Hua's tendril attacks, he had the clarity of mind to aim lightning at her water tendrils, thus electrocuting her.[44]\n" +

            "Mako has noticeable close-range and bare-handed combat skills, able to expertly perform a shoulder-throw.[53] He has also displayed considerable agility, capable of both jumping long distances and performing flips,[40] proving himself difficult to hit at a distance. He has considerable raw strength, as he could effortlessly launch an Equalist agent a great distance, casually carry Bolin over his shoulder or Korra in his arms, and hoist an Equalist into the air with one hand. While under the control of Amon's bloodbending, Mako was able to move his body slightly better than others caught under this technique and managed to aim a bolt of lightning at Amon, something that took the masked man by surprise. Mako is also shown to be quite level-headed in dire situations, and has quick thinking, which was exhibited when he came up with a plan to save his brother from the Equalists during Amon's revelation.\n" +
            "Mako is also good at reading maps, as he figured out where the Equalist rally was located by looking at the maps he and Korra obtained from the Equalist protester. Mako demonstrated this ability again when he discovered where the Equalist airfield was hidden. He also appears to be an adequate cook, preparing meals for himself and Bolin.\n" +

            "As a police officer, Mako uses a motorcycle as his vehicle of choice, displaying great skill with maneuvering it over slick terrain and even incorporating his firebending as a booster to extend the distance of his jumps and to stabilize after a near crash.[4] He is also capable of piloting an airship, though is still an amateur at landing the vehicle\n";

The rest of his group followed suit, as did Team Avatar. At one point in the fight, Jet took out a soldier Sokka was fighting, and told him that he had to be quicker when Sokka protested. When the fight ended, the two groups introduced themselves to each other. Katara became infatuated with the charismatic rogue and Aang was happy to make new friends, but Sokka did not like him. The Duke found barrels full of blasting jelly and Pipsqueak found crates filled with jelly candy, both of which Jet called great scores and advised his group not to get the two mixed up. He invited Aang, Sokka, and Katara to dinner at his tree house. At dinner, Jet gave a humorous account of the battle to his followers.

Sokka, Jet, Pipsqueak, and Smellerbee waited in trees alongside a road. Eventually, an old Fire Nation civilian came walking toward the village. Jet and the fighters ambushed the man while Sokka watched in shock. Jet cruelly interrogated the old man and was about to hurt him when Sokka stopped him. He objected to the poor treatment of harmless civilians, but Jet said that it must be done. The Freedom Fighters robbed the old man and left, Sokka reluctantly going with them.\n" +

They apologized for Sokka's behavior, but Jet told them that he already apologized and that he was on a mission to help the Freedom Fighters. Jet convinced the two of them that the Fire Nation was planning to burn the forest and he needed their help. He took Aang and Katara to the river and told them to use their waterbending on underground geysers to flood the river. He left to help the others set up the blasting jelly on the dam.\n" +
            "Aang and Katara finished their task earlier than expected and went to find Jet. When they got to a cliff, they discovered Jet's plan to destroy the dam. Aang was about to go to stop him, but Jet swooped out of a tree and stole Aang's glider. Jet tried to convince Aang and Katara that he was doing the right thing, but a heartbroken Katara attacked him with water. Aang tried to get his glider back, but Jet defended himself with his hook swords and jumped into the trees. A fight ensued across the treetops between Aang and Jet. Jet eventually got out of the trees and damaged Aang's glider, but Katara caught him off guard and froze him in ice.

            "Remorseful of his actions, Jet and two of his Freedom Fighters, Longshot and Smellerbee, traveled to Ba Sing Se on a ferry for a new start in life. Among the many passengers were Zuko and Iroh. Shortly after the boat took off, he overheard Zuko complaining about the disgusting food; he offered to help Zuko steal better food from the captain, who ate like a \"king\". Zuko and the Freedom Fighters successfully stole the captain's food supply and gave it out to the passengers. Jet admitted to Zuko and Iroh that he did terrible things in his past that he was not proud of, but that was why he and his Freedom Fighters were going to Ba Sing Se to make amends, and get a second chance. Iroh contemplated his decision, believing that people deserve second chances and could change their lives if they wanted.[6]\n" +
            "Jet later talked to Zuko alone, telling him that when he first saw his scar he realized that he was an outcast like himself. Jet stated that they should watch out for each other, because no one else would. Zuko replied that he realized that being alone was not the best path. Jet later offered Zuko a place in his team of Freedom Fighters, but Zuko turned him down. The former Freedom Fighter subsequently noticed that Iroh was served a cold cup of tea, but a few instances later, it was suddenly hot. He deduced that Iroh was a firebender and became enraged.[8] He became intent on confirming that Zuko and Iroh were from the Fire Nation, forgetting his promise to Longshot and Smellerbee to start over, although he later assured Smellerbee that he only intended to gather enough evidence that Iroh and Zuko were Fire Nation citizens to turn them in to the proper authorities.[7]\n" +

            "Later, he made many surreptitious attempts to expose their firebending, such as stealing Iroh's spark rocks, but to no avail, allowing his anger to cloud his judgment once again. He focused his efforts on Iroh, as he had only seen evidence of Iroh's ability to firebend, but believed Zuko was native to the Fire Nation by association. Ignoring Smellerbee and Longshot's concerns, he openly challenged the two fugitives in public. As Jet was an extremely skilled swordsman, he believed that Zuko and Iroh would have no choice but to firebend in order to save themselves. Zuko gladly accepted Jet's challenge and fought Jet on even terms with broadswords he snatched from a nearby soldier, ignoring Jet's attempts to goad him into firebending. The fight dragged out until both fighters lost one of their blades (and Jet's trademark sprig of wheat was cut in half). As the fight went on, the Dai Li arrived to diffuse the situation, and Jet again accused Zuko and Iroh of being Fire Nation, but all the witnesses claimed Zuko and Iroh were assaulted without provocation. A struggling Jet was arrested by the Dai Li and taken to a secret location in Ba Sing Se, later revealed to be their secret headquarters under Lake Laogai. He was subjected to an Earth Kingdom brainwashing technique designed to make him forget about the War.[7]\n" +

Katara did not believe him and preemptively attacked. He briefly defended himself before throwing down his swords and claiming that he simply wanted to help. He said that he overheard talk of Appa being kept in a city storeroom and led the gang there. His story was seemingly confirmed when the gang found a clump of Appa's fur on the premises, and an old janitor claimed that the bison had been moved just the day before to a distant island. However, when the group went outside, they ran into Longshot and Smellerbee, who were relieved to see Jet. However, when they questioned him about his capture by the Dai Li he claimed that it never happened and was confused when Smellerbee insisted on it. Toph's seismic sense told her that Jet and Smellerbee were telling the truth.\n" +
            "Sokka realized the only explanation was that Jet had been brainwashed and used as a plot by the Dai Li to quietly draw the divisive Avatar and his friends away from Ba Sing Se. With his conditioning broken and true memory returning, Jet was able to lead the group to the secret building in Lake Laogai where he had been brainwashed, and where Appa was being kept. They were discovered and fought against a large group of Dai Li agents and Long Feng, the leader of the Dai Li, who proclaimed that Aang and his friends were now enemies of the state. The group managed to fight off the Dai Li, and Jet and Aang chased a fleeing Long Feng into another room. However, there the cunning Long Feng used a new trap against Aang; he spoke a verbal trigger worked into Jet's brainwashing that made Jet fight and attempt to kill Aang.\n" +

Jet regained his senses and attacked Long Feng, who dodged and retaliated with a fatal blow. When the rest of the gang as well as Smellerbee and Longshot showed up, Katara checked his injuries and said that it did not look too good. Smellerbee told them to leave to find Appa. They refused to leave them, but Longshot spoke up, saying that they would stay with him since he was their leader. Jet insisted to Katara that he would be all right, but Toph sensed that he was lying. Smellerbee remained by Jet's side, crying, while Longshot notched an arrow and aimed it at the entrance of the room, ready to prevent any more attack.

            "Months after his death, in the summer of 100 AG, Zuko and Katara went on a mission to find the man who killed Katara's mother, with Katara clearly intent on getting revenge. Aang recognized her rage and remarked that she was acting like Jet. Katara vehemently denied this, claiming that it was different because she was out to get a monster, while Jet was out to kill innocents. She evidently had not forgotten his crimes despite his heroic \"death\", suggesting there may have been a part of her that was still angry with Jet for his past actions.[9]\n" +
            "Jet was later a featured character in a play that Team Avatar attended, entitled The Boy in the Iceberg.

This seemed to blind him to the fact that, when compared to the scope of the War, his group's acts of guerrilla warfare and terrorism were relatively small.[1]\n" +

            "He could be obsessive and paranoid about the Fire Nation.

He possessed masterful skill with his hook swords, able to defeat a master bender, duel evenly with a master swordsman of Zuko's caliber, and hold his own against and overwhelm multiple opponents.

When Zuko went to Sokka's tent to ask him about his mother, he collided with Suki, who suspiciously denied her true intention of seeing Sokka and rushed back to her tent. When Zuko entered the tent, it was apparent that Sokka was waiting to have a romantic evening with Suki, but was surprised and embarrassed to see Zuko instead. After Zuko left the tent, Sokka called out to Suki and, seeing Zuko was still there, whistled guiltily to make him go away.[15]\n" +
            "Suki later donned a Fire Nation disguise and accompanied Team Avatar to the play, \"The Boy in the Iceberg\". In the play, her character was portrayed most accurately, though some physical details, like her headpiece, were slightly exaggerated. During the play, she exchanged looks with Sokka during the scene where they practiced using Kyoshi Warrior outfits and acted jealous when Sokka shushed her during the scene where Yue became the Moon Spirit. When Sokka desired to sneak backstage to help out the actor playing him, Suki assisted him, saying that her years of training in the art of stealth should help. Sokka showed his jokes to actor Sokka, which caused Suki to hit herself on the head. Contrary to her original thoughts, however, actor Sokka found the jokes funny, and used them in the next scenes. Suki called the play horrible and never referred to it again in the series.[16]\n" +

            "Three days prior to the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Suki and the rest of Team Avatar held a beach party on Ember Island. Sokka created a crude sand sculpture of Suki that bore no resemblance to her, but she said that she thought it was sweet of him, resulting in him kissing her. When Zuko informed the group of the Fire Lord's plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom, Aang ran off, and Suki aided in the search for him.[17] When they were unable to find Aang, Zuko took them to the Earth Kingdom, where they \"hired\" June to track him with her giant shirshu, Nyla. When she was unable to, he decided to track Iroh, leading the group to Ba Sing Se, where they were approached by the Order of the White Lotus. It was decided that Suki, Sokka and Toph would destroy the airship fleet. Sokka drove one airship into the others, bringing them down. In the process, Suki was separated from her friends as the airship fell apart underneath them. She insisted that Sokka carry onward with the mission.[18]\n" +

Noticing Toph and Sokka hanging helplessly from another airship, she saved the two by steering her captured aircraft into the other vessel. After Aang had removed Ozai's firebending, the reunited group landed the captured airship and began to taunt the fallen tyrant. Suki also made a lame attempt to do so, earning Toph's criticism of her, \"Leave the nicknames to us, honey.\"[8]\n" +
            "After Zuko was crowned Fire Lord and officially ended the War, Suki finally reunited with her team of warriors, who were released from prison along with Mai and Ty Lee. After discovering how well her team bonded with Ty Lee while in prison, Suki allowed her to join them. Later, the entire gang were relaxing at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se, where Suki played Pai Sho with Mai.

            "A year after the end of the Hundred Year War, Mai asked Suki and the rest of the Kyoshi Warriors to protect the Fire Nation Royal Palace after a failed attempt to murder Fire Lord Zuko by Kori. The first night they were standing guard, Zuko woke up in the middle of the night and went outside. Suki told him it had been quiet all night, to which Zuko apologized saying that he did trust the Kyoshi Warriors as they were the best guardsmen in the world. Suki suggested that he to go back to sleep, however, when Zuko said he was going to get a drink of water, she asked him if needed someone to escort, which the Fire Lord rejected in order to visit his father in prison.[19]\n" +

However, after she found out he left to talk to Ozai, Suki told Mai about Zuko's nightly journeys, asking her to speak with him in hopes of helping him. However, when Mai broke up with him during this talk, Suki felt guilty and confessed that she had been following Zuko. She apologized to Zuko and, while kneeling before the Fire Lord, told him that the Kyoshi Warriors were worried about him and that she, especially, was worried about him as well and reached out for his hand before being interrupted by General Mak.[20]\n" +
            "On the day of the battle for Yu Dao, Suki traveled to the Beifong Metalbending Academy in a Fire Nation war balloon to get Toph and Sokka's help, explaining that she discovered their location when Kunyo complained to the Fire Lord about a \"dirt girl\" and a \"snow savage\" taking over his school. Suki convinced Toph and Sokka to come with her to try and stop the Fire Nation Army from reaching Yu Dao, explaining her plan to them after landing near the military procession. On Sokka's orders, Toph earthbent an underground slide that took them directly under one of the tundra tanks, and the trio quickly seized control of the tank. Suki expressed her feelings of concern for Zuko's well-being, stating that he seemed lonely. However, despite her desire to speak to him, she received no chance, eventually joining the fight against the Fire Nation with Toph at her side. Just as the duo were starting to become overwhelmed, Toph's metalbending students suddenly arrived to come to their aid.[21]\n" +

She showed great concern for Zuko when he entered the cell, and was quick to help the Fire Lord when his sister attacked him. She was reluctant to leave him alone with her afterward, wanting to escort them both back to the palace, but was dismissed.\n" +
            "The next day, she met up with Sokka, who had also traveled to the palace with Aang and Katara upon Zuko's inquiry. She was just in time to prevent her boyfriend and the Avatar from launching an attack on an unbound Azula, telling them to be patient and to allow Zuko to explain.

            "Suki traveled with Sokka after his return from Hira'a to a Fire Nation marketplace, where the two visited Seashell San's House of Shells. She did not realize her boyfriend was into seashells and, upon being told he had a collection he began as a young boy, she asked why she had not seen this. Sokka quickly corrected himself, saying he wanted to be a collector since that point. As she looked around the store, Suki grew skeptical at San's claim that the shells were rare, though giggled at Sokka when he was briefly duped into believing the shells, valued at fifteen ban for one, were on special at two for thirty, calling him a goof in the process. When a girl, Giya, entered the store, San and Jojan believed her to be a fake collector and the former discouraged her from buying shells, prompting Suki to ask if there was a problem. When sternly told by San to mind her own business, she angrily replied that he should treat his customers with respect. The Kyoshi Warrior was grabbed by Jojan in an attempt to remove her from the store, but she began to squirm away, warning the associate to let go. After he did not do so, she flipped him onto the ground. When San tried to attack with firebending, she first sweetly told Sokka she did not need help and kissed him on the cheek as a thanks for offering, before grabbing San and blocking his chi. The couple left the store, though not before Suki told Jojan to keep his hands off someone who told him to do as such.\n" +

She was asked how she learned to fight like that, though she playfully chastised Sokka for bragging that she was a Kyoshi Warrior. A confused Giya said she thought they all wore face paint, but Suki replied that they only did so on duty. The young woman sadly spoke of her desire to be as strong as the warriors because a lot of \"jerks\" hung out in the marketplace. The warrior offered to teach her self-defense, but when an unconfident Giya began to take off, Suki began telling her the story of the Kyoshi Warriors' founding; during Avatar Kyoshi's time, there was a marketplace on Kyoshi Island where undesirable individuals hung out as well. She explained that Kyoshi would deal with these people and offer the women how to defend themselves. Within a few years, these ordinary women banded together as the Avatar's disciples and became the first Kyoshi Warriors. Her story complete, the warrior told Giya that the strength she needed was a learned ability. After the girl accepted her offer and brought along some of her friends, Suki, dressed in her Kyoshi Warrior uniform, began teaching them the ways of her group.[23]\n" +

Her softer side was frequently demonstrated in the presence of Sokka. For a long time during her imprisonment, Suki held out the hope of seeing Sokka again and showed no sign of breaking in the face of Azula's torments pertaining to Sokka.[13] She also had a mild tendency to hold grudges, demonstrated by her initially treating Zuko coldly when they met in prison and readily looking forward to a rematch with Azula and Ty Lee.

She was the last warrior to be captured by Azula, showing the extent of her skill.[5] She was an impressive hand-to-hand combatant, using a style reminiscent of Aikido, as well as fighting with traditional Kyoshi war fans, a style reminiscent of Tessenjutsu, and skilled with the katana. She could hold her own against other skilled fighters, such as Ty Lee, readily avoiding her disabling pressure point strikes, and was a good teacher, passing some of her fighting methods on to Sokka. She also possessed considerable physical strength, able to swim easily in full Kyoshi Warrior armor and toss aside a full grown man with ease. During the breakout of the Boiling Rock, she bypassed a full-scale riot by jumping across the tops of the rioters' heads, scaled the vertical face of a building, demonstrating a skill set similar to that found in parkour, and an acrobatic skill comparable to that of Ty Lee. Following the Hundred Year War, Suki learned chi blocking from Ty Lee. She demonstrated the skill for the first time on San.\n";

However, some of her actions also caused long-term problems for the Earth Kingdom; while ushering the world into a 233-year-long era of peace, the death of Chin the Conqueror and her foundation of the Dai Li would lead to the decline, corruption, and fall of her home country.

She, like all Avatars, mastered all four elements and the Avatar State. When Kyoshi visited the ports of her homeland, she constantly had to put carousing men in their place after they caused trouble to the female villagers. Eventually, she decided to train the women in defensive combat so that they could defend themselves. These women later formed the first band of Kyoshi Warriors.[8]\n" +

Using this to his advantage, a warlord named Chin launched a war to conquer the continent. He was successful until he reached the peninsula where Kyoshi lived. When he refused to listen to Kyoshi, she confronted him and separated the peninsula from the mainland by entering the Avatar State and using a combination of earthbending and airbending, forming Kyoshi Island and thereby protecting her homeland from subsequent threats. An indignant Chin was left standing on the edge of a cliff, which began to crumble beneath his feet, causing him to fall into the sea, where he subsequently drowned. His death ushered the world into a great era of peace.\n" +
            "Because of Kyoshi's act, the people of Chin Village on the mainland founded Avatar Day to vilify Kyoshi, and all succeeding Avatars, for the death of their leader. The people of Kyoshi Island, meanwhile, founded \"Kyoshi Day\" on the same day as Avatar Day, to honor her creation of the island and the restoration of peace to their village.

By the time Kyoshi reached the city, the peasants had already destroyed everything that represented the \"old government\", including ancient and valuable artifacts that held historical and cultural importance. The King demanded that she stop the uprising by whatever means necessary. However, Kyoshi staunchly refused, stating that it would not be right for her to do so. Incensed by her defiance, the Earth King ordered her arrest, but a display of the Avatar's power and a warning intimidated him into a compromise. The Earth King agreed to give the peasants a voice in his ruling, while Kyoshi in turn agreed to protect Ba Sing Se's cultural heritage from further desecration.

Aang pointed out that she was not directly responsible for Chin's death, arguing that it was a result of his own arrogance.

However, after the opening of the Southern spirit portal,[10] humans, such as Unalaq, were able to physically enter once again, and with them, they brought \"darkness and anger\" that threatened to overtake the Spirit World.[1] These negative feelings were amplified during the Harmonic Convergence of 171 AG, when Vaatu used the increased spiritual energy to break free from his prison inside the Tree of Time.[11][12] After the Dark Spirit was defeated, Avatar Korra decided to leave the spirit portals open, once again uniting the Spirit and the mortal world.[7]\n" +

The forest was later restored by Avatar Korra when she reopened the portal, restoring the southern lights. This could be done in the South only during the winter solstice.[10] There is also a spirit portal at the North Pole that would not have to be opened during the solstice, due to the North's stronger relationship to the spirits. When both portals are open, spirits and humans can pass from one pole to the other freely.[19] These portals were closed by Wan in order to create and maintain balance between the spirits and humankind, as well as to keep any human from ever physically crossing over to the Spirit World again and risk freeing Vaatu.[9]\n" +

They were so close that Sozin was able to immediately recognize Roku's crush on Ta Min. They also shared the same birthday, which they celebrated together.\n" +
            "At a party celebrating his and Sozin's sixteenth birthday, Roku was informed by the Fire Sages that he was the Avatar. Before Roku left the Fire Nation to master the other three elements, Sozin came by to talk to him and was informed by Roku that the Sages had told him not to bring anything with him on his travels, as the Avatar required no worldly possessions on his journey. After learning this, Sozin gave him the headpiece worn by the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation, hoping that he was at least allowed to have that, which showed how much Sozin valued their friendship.[2]\n" +

Following the cycle, he needed to learn airbending first, so he traveled to the Southern Air Temple. While there, Roku became good friends with a young monk named Gyatso, Aang's eventual guardian and mentor.\n" +
            "After training for several years, Roku mastered the art of airbending and traveled to the Northern Water Tribe to learn waterbending from a master who lived there. This task was particularly difficult for Roku, as water is the natural opposite of fire. After eventually mastering waterbending, Roku traveled to the Earth Kingdom to learn earthbending, which he also mastered. In addition to mastering earth, Roku formed a great friendship with his teacher, Sud.[2]\n" +

            "During 55 BG, after mastering earthbending, Roku spent five months in retreat at the Fire Temple on Crescent Island, attempting to master the Avatar State under the guidance of Fire Sage Kaja. Growing impatient after failing to master it with meditation, he tried using the winter solstice sun to force himself into the Avatar State. Despite his success, he became trapped under its influence and was unable to control his powers, resulting in the destruction of the upper half of the Fire Temple and the eruption of the nearby volcano. Kaja eventually managed to free Roku from the state by aligning the Avatar's eyes with the winter solstice sun once more, halting the destruction of the temple.[3]\n" +
            "In payment for his near destruction of the Fire Sages' temple, Roku rebuilt parts of the temple and carved new underground passages out of the island's magma. Following the incident, Roku became more patient with his training and completely mastered the Avatar State afterward.\n" +

He reunited with Sozin, who had since been crowned as Fire Lord, greeting each other with a hug. A few months later, Roku married his childhood sweetheart, Ta Min, and had Sozin take the position of his best man during the ceremony. At the wedding, Sozin asked to speak with Roku in private and informed his close friend that he had thought hard about the state of the world.\n" +
            "He told Roku that he firmly believed the Fire Nation had entered a period of great prosperity, and proposed to Roku that together the pair could spread this wealth to the world by expanding the empire.

Roku confronted his old friend and ordered him to end his aggression; Sozin replied that Roku's loyalty lay with the Fire Lord and the nation's progress. Once the Avatar declined this, Sozin attacked him. The two engaged in battle, with Roku easily overpowering his formerly close friend and destroying most of the palace in the process. He spared Sozin's life for the sake of their past friendship, but not before warning him never to move forward with his plans again, as it would otherwise result in his \"permanent end\".[2]\n" +

Through the use of his bending abilities and access to the Avatar State, Roku attempted to contain the volcanic destruction, but lost hope when a second eruption occurred. At that moment, however, Sozin arrived on his dragon and offered his assistance to the Avatar. The two used their bending to try to contain the lava flow, but poisonous gases eventually forced them to flee the mountainside. On their way down, Roku warned Sozin to not breathe the gas and used his airbending to protect the Fire Lord, before succumbing to a gas geyser himself. His vision blurring, Roku pleaded for help, but was left to die, as without him, Sozin could realize his plans of conquest. Right before the pyroclastic flow engulfed him, Fang curled up with Roku, and the two died together.[2]\n" +

There, Roku informed Aang of the impending return of Sozin's Comet and described Fire Lord Ozai's plan to harness the comet's energy and gain victory in the War. He entrusted the young Avatar with the task of mastering the four elements and defeating the Fire Lord before the comet's arrival. Roku also manifested himself in Aang to defeat a group of firebenders who waited outside of the sanctuary to capture the young airbender. He awakened the dormant volcano directly underneath the temple, destroying the structure before the solstice ended.[5]\n" +
            "Roku aided Aang several times after this, appearing to Jeong Jeong to persuade him to teach the Avatar firebending, offering critical wisdom in the ways of the Spirit World during the Siege of the North, informing Aang of how he could save the Moon Spirit and defeat the invading Fire Navy, and revealing to Aang the nature of the Avatar State.[6][7][8] Thus, he acted as somewhat of a mentor and spiritual guide for Aang.\n" +

Roku, however, blamed himself for the entire tragedy, saying that he should have foreseen the War and taken steps to prevent it. He proceeded to tell Aang that he believed it was his destiny to save the world and redeem him.[9] Shortly afterward, Roku appeared to Aang in a dream and said that the young Avatar should visit his homeland, where he would learn about the origins of the War.

He told Roku that he felt insecure about killing Phoenix King Ozai, as he was taught by the Air Nomads to respect all life. While understanding Aang's discomfort, Roku insisted that Aang must kill Ozai in order to save the world. He told Aang that it was his reluctance to end Sozin's life that initially started the Hundred Year War, and that Aang must not make the same mistake by showing mercy to Fire Lord Ozai.[1]\n" +
            "A year after the Hundred Year War, Aang again called on Roku regarding the behavior of Fire Lord Zuko. Aang had promised to Zuko that he would end his life if he ever developed ridiculous plans just as his father had; the young Fire Lord appeared to be in such a mental state when he withdrew his support of the Harmony Restoration Movement. Roku again told Aang he needed to be decisive, as the former again expressed his regret for not ending Fire Lord Sozin's life when he had the chance.[10]\n" +

Aang later arrived at Yu Dao to separate the two battling armies, but at the last moment chose to spare Zuko's life. A few days later, at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se, Roku berated Aang for his mercy in allowing Zuko to live and his failure to keep the four nations separate. Aang retorted that Roku's doctrine no longer applied in the post-war era. Stating that Roku could not teach him any more in this era, Aang burned his fire amulet into ash, breaking the connection to his past life, a tear rolling down his cheek as he did so.[11] This later proved to have great repercussions when Yangchen explained to Aang that by severing his connection with Roku, he damaged his connection with all the Avatars before him as well, leaving Aang unable to contact his other past lives at will.[12]\n" +

            "With Aang needing to get in contact with Yangchen due to Old Iron's approach, he re-established his connection with Roku by re-crafting the fire medallion for his meditation beads. Roku appeared before his apologetic successor and offered him a hug. As they embraced, he told the young Avatar that his past lives could only advise him from their own perspectives and that he had to find balance, not just between human and spirit, but also the past and present. He pointed Aang to his most recent past lives leading up to Yangchen and added that he remember this advice as he looked for a solution to his dilemma.[13]\n" +

He and every other Avatar present entered the Avatar State to restore her bending, and disappeared when this task was completed.[14] He also appeared when Korra was suffering from amnesia, taking over from Avatar Aang, and told her that in order to recover her identity, she needed to reconnect with her Avatar Spirit.[15]\n" +
            "While Unalaq was attacking Raava, Korra envisioned Roku among the Avatar lineup she had seen prior to regaining her bending; however, his connection to Korra was severed due to Unalaq's assault on and subsequent destruction of the light spirit.[16]\n" +

Among his abilities, he could bend lava and cool it with his breath, move fairly large amounts of earth or water, quickly tunnel through earth, fly using an Air Nomad glider or mini-tornado, and create a shield of air large enough to cover a whole village. His control was not only powerful but precise â€“ he could leave a single rock pillar standing while he leveled a building, and melt chains on others while leaving them unharmed.[5]\n" +

Being his natural opposite, he found it difficult to learn at first, but in time, he mastered it.

He excelled in the art, eventually being able to best his master Sud in an earthbending wave race up a mountain. Roku won by such a large margin that he was able to make tea for them both before Sud arrived. He could also quickly and silently burrow through the ground to surprise his opponents. Later, while defending his home from the volcanic eruption, he was able to skillfully handle the ever moving ground by shifting it to maintain his footing, even managing to do the same for Sozin despite the ongoing eruption.\n" +

                "About:\n"+ "June was a bounty hunter who traveled around the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation. Of all the bounty hunters in the world, she was the best and most expensive of her time. She was a mercenary and had no allegiance to any nation, only to the highest bidder for her services.[2]\n" +
                "She was a confident and self-assured woman who possessed a dry, sarcastic wit. She was also considered beautiful, in a dangerous sort of way, and had incredible physical strength. June would arm wrestle men in bars on a bet, before squandering her winnings on a round of drinks. June wore a band with a skull motif around her top-knot.\n" +
                "She tracked her prey with the help of her mount, Nyla, a shirshu. Though blind, it saw by means of its powerful scent receptors, reportedly sensitive enough to \"smell a rat a continent away\". To capture her targets, June depended on her shirshu to use its long whip-like tongue coated in paralyzing toxins to stun them.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Contents[show]\n" +
                "History\n" +
                "June originated from the Earth Kingdom where she spent her childhood traveling with her father, who was also a bounty hunter. It was from him that she adopted the tracking and fighting skills she employed. June's father received a shirshu from a rare animal collector in payment for a bounty, and gave it to her. The shirshu become June's inseparable companion.[2]\n" +
                "June captures stowaway\n" +
                "June successfully captured her target with the help of Nyla.\n" +
                "Early in 100 AG, June tracked a fleeing target who had stowed on board Zuko's ship and captured him while inflicting mild damage to the ship. Iroh developed an immediate interest in her while Zuko was angered, though quietly impressed, with her proficiency and skill. After finding the huntress, they employed her to track down Aang by following his trail after obtaining Katara's scent from her necklace. They successfully found Aang at a nearby abbey where she was largely occupied with an angry Appa. Eventually Nyla was \"blinded\" by a large quantity of perfume that Katara had waterbent over it. As the shirshu lashed out in confusion, June and Zuko were both temporarily paralyzed. Iroh caught and supported her and was content to feign paralysis simply to get close and hold her. Although the act clearly annoyed her, she could not do anything about it.[1]\n" +
                "Zuko pleading with June\n" +
                "June was urged by Zuko to find Avatar Aang.\n" +
                "At summer's end, a reformed Zuko and Team Avatar went in search of her hoping to use her shirshu to find the unaccounted-for Aang. Initially, June was not interested until Zuko gave her some encouragement, mentioning \"the end of the world\". However, Aang's scent could not be found, as if he did not exist.[3] Instead, Zuko suggested they search for Iroh, hoping he would know; she soon led them outside the broken walls of Ba Sing Se, saying that Iroh was just on the other side of the large pile of debris and with her job complete, she wished the group good luck before riding off.[4]\n" +
                "After the Hundred Year War, Zuko hired June in one of his many attempts to track down his long lost mother; to no avail.[5]\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Personality\n" +
                "In June's profession, she had to mix with a variety of people from unsavory to low life as well as regular characters. Her determination, resolve and superior physical strength enabled her to get the job done in the toughest of assignments. June's character along with her shirshu's abilities made her a force to be reckoned with.\n" +
                "A fearless and non-fragile woman who was rarely misunderstood, June was also confident and decisive, though occasionally sassy. While she was often dark and uncaring, she did not ask for payment from Zuko when he said that the world would be destroyed and needed her help, proving that loyalty to her pocket was not the only consideration.\n" +

                "June was a professional bounty hunter and an experienced shirshu rider. Despite her slender frame, she was also deceptively strong, as she was able to effortlessly defeat a muscular man in an arm-wrestling match[1] and lift up a grown man.[1] Additionally, June proved to be a formidable fighter, as she demonstrated amazing speed, hand-to-hand combat skills, and evasiveness. She was able to defeat multiple opponents before a cup she was drinking from, which she had thrown in the air, hit the ground.[3] She was also known to be skilled in using the whip.\n", 13, 3, 0, 6, 25, 3, 1, 6);
